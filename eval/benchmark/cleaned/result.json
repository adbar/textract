        "articleBody": "by Ragnar Redbeard\nFrom: \"Ragnar Redbeard\"\nIt has been suggested in this newsgroup (alt.christianity) in response to my\nquestion regarding the origin of 666 that the number 666 has its roots in numerology.\nThis is the school of thought that agree with. The number 666 has its origins\nin ancient numerology / astrology, and is connected to what are called \"magic\nsquares\". The ancients devised a scheme of numbers arranged in squares and ordered\nin such a way that by adding each row and column, one would reach the same total\neach time. 666 comes from the square associated with the Sun, which is made\nup of every number from 1 to 36. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 36 is of course,\n666. Surrounding the Sun Square are the 12 divisibles of 666 which are attached\nto the 12 signs of the Zodiac.\n666 = Pisces\n333 = Aquarius\n222 = Capricorn\n111 = Sagitaurus\n74 = Scorpio\n37 = Libra\n18 = Virgo\n9 = Leo\n6 = Cancer\n3 = Gemini\n2 = Taurus\n1 = Aries\nHere is what the Sun Square looks like:\n6 32 3 34 35 1\n7 11 27 28 8 30\n19 14 16 15 23 24\n18 20 22 21 17 13\n25 29 10 9 26 12\n36 5 33 4 2 31\nThe factors of 666 are 666, 333, 222, 111, 74, 37, 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, and 1. They\nare attached to the Zodiac signs as follows:\nSo, each of the six rows has a total of 111 (6 rows x 111 = 666). Each of\nthe 6 columns also has a total of 111.\nThe Sun Square contains 9 squares and rectangles whose corners total 74 ( 9\nX 74 = 666 ) One example is \"6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74\"\nFor those who practiced numerology / astrology, the numbers 666 and 74 were\nconsidered 'holy' numbers, associated with the Sun, which they revered. Numerology\n/ Astrology (from now on referred to as Hermetica) also became a recurring phenomenon\nin the bible, particularely the KJV. Many of the numbers which are sacred to\nHermetica are found to be recurring throughout the KJV, 666 being the most obvious.\nThe famous reference to 666 is found in revelation, but another exists in 1\nKings 10:14 where Solomon takes 666 talents of gold from neighboring kingdoms.\nSolomon is one of the more important examples of this biblically coded wisdom.\nSolomon is basically the figure head of the 12 tribes of Israel during his\nreign as king. Solomon represents the Sun and the Sun Square and the 12 tribes\nof Israel are the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The 666 clue found in 1 Kings is one\nhint - another is the name Solomon. \"Sol\" is the Latin word for the Sun, \"Om\"\nis the Hindi word for the Sun, and \"On\" is the Egyptian word for the Sun.\nWhile 666 is the most famous reference to the practice of Numerology found\nin the bible, there are many others which are more subtle. First a quick point\nregarding history:\nIn approximately 325 A.D. Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to be the\nofficial religion of the Roman Empire. His reasons are the topic of another\ndiscussion, but for better or worse it is a fact. For the next 1500 years, all\nother religions or philosophies were ruthlessly purged from the Roman Empire,\nto the point of knowledge of many ancient religions becoming extinct. The Ancients,\nrealizing that practicing Hermetica (Numerology / Astrology) meant a visit to\nthe torture chamber, did what anyone in their position would do - they hid their\nknowledge. The were fortunate in the fact that they were practically the only\nones with any sort of education, and thus were trusted to read, write, and interpret\nfor Rome. Fast forward to somewhere in the 1600's when King James decided that\nthe bible should be available in English and commissioned a group of scholars\nincluding Francis Bacon* to oversee the translation of the bible from Hebrew\n& Latin to English. Francis Bacon was a member of the chain of minds that\nsprang from the Ancient Philosophers and he constructed the KJV in such a way\nthat the knowledge they possessed may be preserved. All one has to do is decipher\nit.\nNow, with that in mind, we can look at the bible and understand why it is arranged\nthe way it is. If someone was to write a code without leaving any sort of decoding\nmanual, it stands to reason that the means of decoding his work would have to\nbe included in his work. The first step to deciphering this code would be to\nlook for extremes. Take for example, Psalm 117. It sits at the exact center\nof the bible (in traditional order) and is the shortest chapter in the bible.\nAs such, it almost jumps out and screams \"Hey, look at me!\" Psalms 117 has exactly\n33 words. By no coincidence there are 33 years in the life of Christ, and 33\ngenerations from Adam to David.\n*There are those who believe that it was Francis Bacon who wrote the works\nattributed to Shakespeare. Here is a little tidbit suggestive of this theory.\nCount 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible. You will find that it\nis Psalm 46. Count 46 words into that chapter and find that the 46th word is\n\"Shake\". Count 46 words backwards from the end of that chapter and find that\nthe 46th word is \"spear\". The mathematical laws of probability eliminate the\n\"coincidence\" theory, and we conclude that with this method of \"counting the\nbible\" rather than reading the bible we are on the right track.\nDue to a period of over one thousand years in which anything other than Church\napproved subject matter was relentlessly purged, intimate knowledge of pre-Christian\nreligious practices (particularely those related to Numerology) is scarce. Some\nrudimentary information still remains, such as the names and fables associated\nwith the Pagan lore, along with some fundamental Numerology / Astrology concepts.\nMany are familiar with the tales of Thor, Odin (Wotan, Woden), Zues, and the\nwhole pantheon of gods and goddesses. The horoscopic information that exists\nin today's New Age circles consists mainly of simple clairvoyance and \"love\nspells\". Many New Age occultists use the principles of Gematria and such to\ndiscover \"their\" number, and so on.\nAncient 'magicians' used 7 unique number squares as the basis for their wisdom.\nEach square was arranged in such a way that the total of any column or row was\nthe same. Each of the seven 'magic' squares was also assigned a planetary value.\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, and the Sun, are all associated\nwith a specific square. It is the Sun Square that is most relevent to bible\ncoding. The sun square is the 4th of the 7 magic squares and consists of every\nnumber from 1 to 36, arranged in six rows and six columns. Each of the six rows\nadds up to 111 and each of the six columns adds to 111. It is from the Magic\nSquare of the Sun that the infamous number 666 originates. 6 columns X 111 =\n666. 6 rows X 111 = 666. All of the numbers 1 through 36 total 666. There are\na total of 3 squares and 6 rectangles within the Sun Square, each of which adds\nto 74, and are listed below. 9 rectangles & squares X 74 = 666.\n6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74\n11 + 8 + 26 + 29 = 74\n16 + 15 + 21 + 22 = 74\n7 + 3 + 12 + 25 = 74\n19 + 24 + 13 + 18 = 74\n32 + 35 + 2 + 5 = 74\n3 + 34 + 4 + 33 = 74\n14 + 23 + 17 + 20 = 74\n27 + 28 + 9 + 10 = 74\nThe numbers to keep track of here are 9, 74, and 666, as they will turn up\nelsewhere later.\nVery possibly, the other squares contain number patterns that can be found\nin the bible, but our focus will remain with the Sun Square. The number 666\nhas 12 divisibles, and these divisibles are associated with the 12 signs of\nthe Zodiac. The Sun Square and its 12 divisibles (or 12 signs of the Zodiac)\nserve to form a theme which was to become common in many later religions. Odin\nhad 12 chief priests, Solomon had 12 tribes of Israel, and Jesus had 12 disciples.\nThe 1 + 12 phenomenon is found in other areas as well. In U.S. courts, there\nis a Judge, and twelve jurors. Anglo-Saxon folklore tells of King Arthur and\ntwelve Knights of the Round Table. Upon reflection this should be an obvious\nanalogue as King Arthur and the Round Table represent the Sun and the Sun Square,\nand the 12 Knights represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac.\nIt should be clear that the chances of these religions and folklore sharing\nthe 1 + 12 theme being a coincidence is gradually falling. Furthermore, since\nthe 1 + 12 theme appears primarily in Western religions, it is likely that they\noriginate from one source. This source has been given many names throughout\nthe centuries and usually takes the form of secret societies. At one point it\nwas discovered that certain sounds affected the subconcious mind, and it was\nlong known that the human animal is a herd animal. Perceptive people realized\nthat the two should be mixed very carefully. Some sound arrangements had a soothing\neffect, while some had an angering effect, or a saddening effect. Ancient temples\nwere often constructed in such a way that the songs sung during services would\nhave a maximum effect on the mass. Certain notes can shatter glass, or render\nhumans unconcious, and it was this power that these societies intended to conceal.\nUnscrupulous people could easily use this knowledge to the detriment of society.\nWhen languages were constructed, their vowels and consonants were assigned numerical\nvalues. The study of this alphabetic / numerical association is called Gematria,\nand Gematria is used to assign numbers to sounds (words, phrases, etc.).\nDeities, or important figures in mythology and religion are constructed in\naccordance with the principles outlined above. English Gematria assigns the\nvalue of \"1\" to the letter \"A\", and \"2\" to the letter \"B\", etc. With this in\nmind, look at the word \"Jesus\":\nJ E S U S\n10 + 5 + 19 + 21 + 19 = 74\nLet it also be known that the word Jesus in Greek adds to \"888\" in Greek Gematria.\nGreek Gematria increases by a factor of 10 each 8 characters, and the 24th characther\nhas a value of 800. Jesus is referred to as being the offspring of David throughout\nthe bible, and that referrence is due to the fact that the numerical value of\nJesus can be found in the Mars Square. If the Star of David is drawn in the\nMars Square, and the numbers in the Mars Square are reduced to single digits,\nwe observe the following phenomenon:\n2 6 7 2 3\n4 3 7 8 7\n8 5 4 3 9\n1 9 1 5 4\n5 6 1 2 6\nAfter drawing the Star of David inside this square, we see that the points\non the two triangles collect the numbers in such a way that each triangle has\na value of 741. The first triangle has the tip at the number '7' in the first\nrow, and its two base points sit at 4 and 1, if we travel clockwise. The inverted\ntriangle has its upper right point at the 7 in the last column, and travels\nacross the column to arrive at the 4 in the first column, and finally the 1\nat the tip. Inside the hexagram that the center of the Star forms, we see the\nnumber 741 travel down the vertical axis and the number 543 travel across the\nhorizontal axis. 741 + 147 = 888 and 543 + 345 = 888. This is why Jesus is referred\nto as a branch of David.\nNote that the word \"Joshua\" adds to \"74\" in the same way Jesus does, and incidentally\nso does the word \"occult\".\nEven though it is thought to be common knowledge that a man named \"Shakespeare\"\nwrote the collection of classic plays, an interesting 'coincidence' is found\nby employing the coding concepts used by Francis Bacon (who supervised the writing\nof the KJV). If we count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible, we\narrive at Psalm 46. Excluding the mysterious word \"selah\" (which appears 74\ntimes throughout the KJV) we count 46 words from the beginning of the chapter\nand find the 46th word to be \"shake\". The 46th word from the end of the chapter\nis \"spear\". This is coincidental to the theory held by some that Francis Bacon\nwrote the works attributed to Shakespeare\nWhen constructing a code that is designed to be deciphered without a 'decoder's\nguide' a cryptographer will use extremes as pointers to show us the structure\nof the code. Tools such as longest, shortest, and repetition serve to draw attention.\nIn keeping with this theory, we notice that the shortest chapter in the bible,\nPsalm 117, is also placed in the exact center. It contains exactly 33 words,\nwhich by no coincidence is the number of years in the life of Christ, the number\nof generations from Adam to David, and the number of degrees in Freemasonry.\nOn counting sets of 33 chapters from the beginning of the bible we find that\nthe 9th set lands on 1 Kings 6. 9 sets of 33 chapters backwards from Psalm 117,\nwe find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 7. The chapters 1 Kings 6 and 1 Kings\n7 detail the construction of Solomon's Temple. The Temple is begun in 1 Kings\n6, and construction ends in 1 Kings 7.\nDue to the fact that the word \"temple\" is often associated with perfected man,\nand wisdom, a great deal of coding can be found within the biblical concept\nof Solomon. The word \"Solomon\" serves a dual purpose in the coding of the bible.\nThe word \"Sol\" is Latin for \"sun\", the word \"Om\" is Hindi for \"sun\" and the\nword \"On\" is Egyptian for \"sun\". Also, the vowel \"o\" is symmetrically placed\nthroughout the word 3 times. Note that \"o\" is the 15th letter in the alphabet:\nO O O\n15 15 15\n1 + 5 1 + 5 1 + 5 = 666\nEven when presented with information such as this, the Christians will grow\nstronger in their proclaimations that the practice of Numerology is evil. Sometimes\nit will be suggested that perhaps this coding was designed by the devil to discredit\nthe 'truth' of Christianity. Nonetheless Solomon was designed to code 666 and\nthe Sun Square, and makes references to the 'temple', all of which are concepts\nborrowed from the ancient Occult.\nNot unlike the 1 + 12 theme, the recurrence of the number \"7\" in religion and\nmythology is significant. The Seven Seals of Revelation is a reference to the\n7 magic Squares, as are other references to 7 in the bible:\nSeven horns and seven eyes are the seven spirits of God (Rev 5:6), Seven lamps\nof fire which are the seven spirits of God (Rev 4:5) are all references to the\n7 magic squares.\nSometimes methods other than Gematria and Numerological coding are used, and\nin Revelation 2:17 we discover coded in that verse the belief system held by\nFrancis Bacon and the Initiates who wrote the King James Bible. Revelation 2:17\nreads\n\"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches;\nTo him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give\nhim a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth\nsaving he that receiveth it\"\nIn this case, the passage points to a new name written in 'a white stone'.\nIf one were to unscramble the words 'a white stone' we will get 'thee is wotan'.\nRemember Wotan is a deity in the pantheon known as Asatru, and sometimes goes\nby the name 'Woden' or 'Odin'. The odds on that being a coincidence simply cannot\nbe fathomed.\nOther than the passages to be unscrambled (\"a white stone\" - \"thee is wotan\")\nand the subtle references to the magic squares, most of the words in the bible\nare 'filler', which serve no real interpretive purpose. The bible is so full\nof contradictions and pure nonsense that it only stands to reason that it was\nnot meant to be read, but counted. Other theories suggest that the King James\nbible was written as a time-bomb designed to destroy Christianity. Others suggest\nthat Christianity in general was designed to destroy the West, and that the\nKJV was designed to warn us and was coded to preserve ancient wisdom. Both theories\nfit the facts outlined above, but it is doubtful that the whole story will ever\nbe known.\nNow that the coding system has been discovered, the dominoes will begin to\nfall. Given enough time, we can no doubt unravel all of the wisdom encoded into\nthe KJV and discover the knowledge known only by a few, and persecuted by religious\ntyrants for hundreds of years. This essay outlined a few pointers and coding\nprinciples and the reader is encouraged to discover more. Remember, count the\nbible, don't read it!\nRR\nVisit: Satanic Reds"

Draft resolution\n1. Strong, steady growth can be noted in human mobility. Europe, which is viewed as an area of stability and prosperity, will continue in coming years to be immensely attractive to migrants from less-favoured countries and to asylum seekers fleeing wars, persecution and human rights violations.\n2. In a multicultural, multi-ethnic Europe, which is increasingly a refuge for asylum seekers and a destination for immigrants, the most pressing challenge for governments is to guarantee that the fundamental values of our societies, such as the respect of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, will be shared by everyone living in Europe.\n3. It is necessary to take up this challenge in order to be able to benefit fully from the opportunities that immigration offers Europe in terms of the supply of labour, intellectual input and cultural diversity.\n4. The concept of integration aims at ensuring social cohesion through accommodation of diversity understood as a two-way process. On the one hand, immigrants have to accept basic values of European societies. On the other, host societies have to respect immigrants\u2019 dignity and distinct identity and to take it into account when elaborating domestic policies.\n5. In accordance with its previous recommendations and resolutions, the Parliamentary Assembly reiterates the importance of implementing effective policies to ensure full integration of foreigners residing lawfully in Council of Europe member states as part of an overall strategy covering all aspects of migration, including labour migration and illegal migration, and the efforts to combat trafficking in human beings and to combat terrorism.\n6. In this connection, the Assembly refers to its Recommendation 1625 (2003) on policies for the integration of immigrants in Council of Europe member states and in particular reasserts the principle that immigrants should be able to participate fully in the life of the host country, on the basis of equality of rights and opportunities in return for equality of obligations. Those obligations include showing respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, for the principle of equality between women and men and, generally, for the Constitution and laws of the host state.\n7. Council of Europe member states must, for their part, ensure that, within their jurisdiction, immigrants are not discriminated against in terms of access to and protection of their rights, with a particular attention to certain sectors, such as education and employment.\n8. The Assembly draws attention to the many activities pursued by the Council of Europe's intergovernmental committees, in particular the European Committee on Migration (CDMG), to devise and promote integration policies capable of meeting the current challenges.\n9. In this connection, the Assembly calls on Council of Europe member states to:\ni. make it one of their political priorities to agree a migration strategy, entailing an overall approach encompassing all aspects of migration, including its causes and consequences and the challenges it raises. In this context, it would be appropriate to:\na. emphasise the importance of co-development policies, with the aim of reducing poverty in the countries of origin, while giving them responsibility for managing development instruments and resources;\nb. take steps to avoid migratory movements generated by the need for protection, through activities and means of pressure aimed at preventing conflicts and promoting respect for human rights in the countries of origin;\nii. ensure, in all their activities that may have implications for migration, including fighting terrorism, strict respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and the protocols thereto;\niii. offer opportunities for lawful immigration, with a view to employment, to a number of would-be emigrants on the basis of a selection founded on objective criteria which take account of labour market needs in the host country and its social system's capacity to guarantee a reasonable standard of living for these workers and their families;\niv. make a subsequent effort to foster knowledge of the fundamental values of the Council of Europe at all levels within society, in particular among immigrants, by:\na. holding courses on basic rights and responsibilities for newly arrived immigrants, free of charge;\nb. including this type of instruction in optional or mandatory integration schemes for immigrants in those countries where such schemes exist;\nc. where possible, organising this type of instruction in the countries of origin for would-be emigrants whose applications have been accepted;\nv. promote campaigns for the distribution of reliable, clear information, not liable to be interpreted in a racist or xenophobic manner, on migration and on the culture, traditions and integration objectives of immigrants living within their borders;\nvi. develop reliable instruments for measuring migratory movements at national level and co-operate in ensuring data comparability at an international level.\n10. In addition, the Assembly invites the European Union to:\ni. pursue its efforts to establish a common asylum and migration policy;\nii. support the new member states' efforts to cope with illegal immigration and to endow them with legal and practical means of enhancing immigrants' integration;\niii. help raise European public awareness of the consequences of the accession of the new member states and of their citizens' rights with regard to freedom of movement.\nII. Explanatory memorandum by Mr Jean-Guy Branger\n\"Immigrants are a living testimony to history and to the present.\" Emile Mallet, Sociologist\nI. Introduction\n1. The issues raised by immigration and integration represent a huge challenge that Europe must now take up. This is because human mobility is showing strong, steady growth. Europe, which is perceived as a stable, prosperous area, will continue in coming years to be extremely attractive to migrants from less fortunate countries. The Council of Europe has to take full part in debate on the integration process, as the challenge posed is consistent with fulfilment of its principal objectives.\n2. The vast majority of people who have settled in Europe on a long-term basis have gradually become integrated in the population of the host country and aspire to live there peacefully, being aware of the advantages Europe has to offer in terms of respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, employment and access to health care and, in the case of their children, to education. Yet most of the Council of Europe member states are now reconsidering the integration policies they have pursued to date, which have not succeeded fully satisfactorily in integrating immigrants lawfully resident on their territory and members of their families into the economic, social and political set-up of the country. This situation is reflected in the compartmentalisation of society and fosters feelings of intolerance and xenophobia.\n3. While western Europe has taken in tens of millions of immigrants who came in search of freedom and the opportunity to prosper, it is now the destination of waves of migrants from areas where not only is there rampant poverty, but despotic governments or terrorist groups act in an arbitrary fashion or are guilty of persecution or violence. All that these prospective immigrants know about European civilisation is that it is materially successful; they are unaware of the rules underpinning our societies, which are based on the principles of equality and the universality of human rights. These migrants put our societies in a paradoxical situation, insofar as people come to Europe in search of protection against arbitrary rule and access to political, social and financial independence, whereas certain groups would like to impose rules governing \"immigrant communities\" that are at variance with the independence that goes hand-in-hand with equality and the universality of human rights.\n4. It is all the more difficult to rise to the challenge as the second-generation and third-generation children of immigrants sometimes claim to adhere to \"fundamentalist\" groups, whereas their parents wanted themselves and their children to become integrated into the host society.\n5. This challenge is having to be addressed in a difficult climate, in which there is a decline in the number of industrial jobs in Europe as a result of relocation and, at the same time, an influx of poorly-skilled immigrants who, precisely the because of their lack of skills, have problems in finding jobs. It has to be admitted that the difficulties experienced by certain immigrants are exploited, under the pretext of the strict enforcement of certain religious laws, for subversive political ends, which go so far as to include enlistment by terrorist groups, as is borne out by the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 and those in Madrid on 11 March 2004.\n6. It must likewise be admitted that certain iniquitous religious leaders stir up feelings of hatred or even racism towards the host society or some sections of that society. This is leading to an unacceptable resurgence of the anti-Semitism that left its tragic mark on Europe's history. Our countries must not turn a blind eye to these challenges to their own values and must take a firm stand in response to those who call for ever-greater tolerance and who at the same time disseminate messages of hatred or even encourage terrorism. This firm stand must, however, be taken with due regard for the rules laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutional safeguards in force in European countries.\n7. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has paid particularly close attention to the question of integrating immigrants, a field in which it has adopted, inter alia, Recommendation 712 (1973) on integration of migrant workers with the society of their host countries, Resolution 631 (1976) on integration of migrants into society as regards education and cultural development, Recommendation 1206 (1993) on integration of migrants and community relations, Recommendation 1500 (2001) on participation of immigrants and foreign residents in political life in the Council of Europe member states and Recommendation 1596 (2003) on the situation of young migrants in Europe. The Rapporteur also wishes to mention Recommendation 1625 (2003) on policies for the integration of immigrants in Council of Europe member states, and in particular the principle that immigrants should be able to participate fully in the life of the host country's society on the basis of equality of rights and opportunities in return for equality of obligations.\n2. Fundamental values of the Council of Europe\n8. The fundamental values upheld by the Council of Europe are human rights, pluralist democracy, the rule of law, which takes precedence over force, and the promotion of the cultural diversity of Europe. This diversity is not a culture in itself, but a mosaic of different cultures.\n9. Since 11 September 2001 it has been necessary to supplement these values with a political objective common to all member states: that of combating terrorism, which, having struck in other parts of the world before reaching our borders, made its full presence felt within Europe itself, with the bloody attack in Madrid in March 2004 (a repeat of the attacks in Paris in 1986, among others). The constant threat we face from terrorist groups is such that we cannot lower our guard in the near or foreseeable future: it is a key factor that must now be incorporated in our discussions on immigration and integration.\n10. Fundamentalism can lead to terrorism, and we must take this into account in our own countries by ensuring that the groups concerned do not have a podium within our national borders that they can use to spread hate; at the same time, we must be careful that the, albeit necessary, measures taken do not undermine the Council of Europe's values by imposing unwarranted, disproportionate restrictions on immigrants' personal freedoms or by discriminating against them. Combating illegal immigration, and dismantling the human trafficking networks which are, unfortunately, all too common on European territory, are also priorities for the future. France, with the reform of its legislation early in 2004 at the instigation of Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, is one of the countries behind this approach.\n3. Demographic context\n3.1. Statistics1\n3.1.1. Population trends in the main regions of Europe from 1950 to 2050\n11. Analyses for western Europe based on work by the United Nations dating from 2001 reveal the following situation: after a very steep population increase between 1950 and 1975, the pace of increase declines until 2010; the population then tends to stagnate until 2013, after which it begins to fall increasingly steeply until 2050.\n12. In southern Europe there is a substantial increase until the 1990s, which then slows down until 2010, after which the population falls sharply, to return to the 1960 figure by 2050.\n13. In northern Europe, the population increase is moderate but steady from the 1950s to the 2030s, and then declines very slightly until 2050.\n14. In eastern Europe, excluding the Russian Federation, the situation is somewhat comparable to that in southern Europe, with an even more substantial rise in population until the 2000s, followed by a much faster, sharper fall, bringing the population in 2050 back to what it was in 1950.\n15. The situation in the Russian Federation is even more dramatic: having shot up in the period up to the 1990s, the population falls particularly quickly and spectacularly up to 2050.\n16. All these analysis are based on the likely hypothesis that the fertility rate will rise slightly but will never be sufficient to make good the difference between the number of births and the number of deaths, as the latter is, on average, increasingly high.\n17. We can therefore expect a general decline in Europe's population, which it will not be possible to offset by fertility alone.\n3.1.2. Fertility2\n18. The annual fertility rate in Europe is particularly low, although there are many geographical disparities. Europe is having to cope with an ageing population, and hence a shrinking work force, matched by an increase in the retired population.\n19. In France, births exceed deaths by a figure of some 250,000. Norway and the Netherlands also have significant excesses of births over deaths. The United Kingdom has a slight excess, while in Sweden there are equal numbers of births and deaths. In Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Poland, there has been a small variation, resulting in the number of births being slightly lower than the number of deaths. In Germany and central Europe there are already more deaths than births: the situation is alarming in the Russian Federation.\n20. At the same time, the populations of the United States and Canada are growing steadily.\n3.1.3. Migration3\n21. The 20th century saw an increase in migration, one reason being the growing number and increasing speed of means of communication. Unfortunately, however, the main explanation is the existence, firstly, of major world conflicts and, secondly, of local/regional conflicts nearer home.\n22. Before the Second World War, Europe had more emigrants than immigrants. The trend was gradually reversed and, little by little, spread even to the southern European countries. The collapse of the Soviet Union did not lead to as great a population movement towards western Europe as had been feared in certain quarters, particularly in view of the enlargement of the European Union. On the other hand, the conflicts tearing central and west Africa apart, along with poverty and population growth rates that always exceed economic growth, however vigorous that may be, prompt thousands of men and women to try to emigrate to Europe.\n23. It is worth taking a look at the percentage of immigrants in a number of countries between 1980 and 2000. In Belgium it was fairly stable, apart from a slight fall in the late 1980s, at 9% of the total population. In Germany, apart from a decline between 1992 and 1994, which was soon made good, it increased steadily, from 7.2 to about 8.3%. In Italy, which was for long time an emigration country, the proportion remained very low, even though it rose rapidly, from 0.3 to 2.8%, largely because of the arrival of an ever-growing number of illegal immigrants from Africa in Sicily and other Mediterranean islands, such as Lampedusa, or from Albania and the Balkans. It is particularly worth taking note of the situation in Switzerland, which is completely different, in that Switzerland is the only Council of Europe member state to have introduced and administered a genuine immigration policy, quantified according to its needs: the proportion of the population accounted for by immigrants rose from 14% in 1980 to over 19% in 1996; this was followed by a steady but as yet moderate fall to just over 18% of the total population.\n3.2. Excess of births over deaths and net migration\n24. Net migration, or the difference over a given period between the number of emigrants and the number of immigrants, is a variable that is difficult to assess in many countries, because the figures used to establish it are often unreliable, particularly on account of illegal immigration, which is inherently difficult to quantify. The myth of \"Fortress Europe\" must be refuted, as is demonstrated by the report by Mr Thierry Mariani, French member of parliament. In the year 2000, 1.7 million people lawfully entered the 15-member European Union alone, while the number of new illegal immigrants is estimated at 500,000. The total figure of 2,200,000 people means that five times the population of Luxembourg, or a population equivalent to that of the city of Berlin, settled in Europe in one year. France took in some 200,000 new legal immigrants in 2002, while 150,000 people obtained French nationality and were therefore no longer counted as foreigners.\n25. The actual figure is very often twice that indicated by the official statistics. Even if we were to double the latter, however, the result would not be sufficient to offset the general decline in fertility.\n26. Can population trends be influenced? There is no certainty that it will be possible to bring about a resurgence of the birth rate, a very uncertain parameter, in all the member states. Moreover, the effects of any such resurgence would not be apparent until much later, since it is estimated that it takes 25 years for a demographic change of this kind to make itself felt. As for the decline in mortality and the increase in longevity, we can only welcome these trends and hope that they continue and are matched by an improvement in the quality of life in the extra years gained. Account has to be taken of decline in mortality, which is accompanied by ageing of the population, which places a heavy burden on national and European budgets.\n27. This brings us to the European context of migration. Europe has to prepare itself to continue to receive new arrivals. This immigration may be desired and organised (selective immigration) or uncontrolled. The immigrants will have to be integrated, and it must be borne in mind that the previous generations were not always integrated easily or satisfactorily.\n28. The experts all agree that immigration cannot be considered a miracle solution that will offset the effects of the ageing of the population and the falling birth rate, for immigrants themselves are ageing, and their average age is only slightly lower than that of the host population. There are those who contend that this means that ever-increasing immigration is necessary. Massive immigration might be more profitable in purely demographic terms and could attenuate the impact of the ageing of the population, but the benefits have to be set against the fact that the number of jobs, including those that are most accessible, is shrinking because industries are relocating outside Europe, and against the economic and social problems that massive immigration may cause, given that the integration process is inherently slow.\n4. Migration context\n4.1. Historical background\n29. It should first be noted that, although instruments for measuring migration exist, the figures produced are often inaccurate, either because of a lack of political will or because the resources needed to use them are lacking. This is the case in the most highly developed countries. The situation is even more complicated in countries where facilities for monitoring migration are not yet properly established, as in some of the new EU member states.\n30. Immigration takes very different forms, depending on the country concerned, its geographical location and its history.\n31. After taking in immigrant labour, after the Second World War, from its eastern and southern regions and then from North Africa and the former colonies, Europe is now taking in migrants from countries where there is great social deprivation, from war zones and from areas ruled by despots.\n32. Germany, for instance, took in 12 million refugees of German origin after 1945, and 3 million East Germans between 1949 in 1961. Thereafter, the bulk of immigration came from Portugal, Greece and the former Yugoslavia. This was followed by substantial Turkish immigration, currently estimated at nearly 3 million people.\n33. The Netherlands took in 300,000 returning emigrants from Indonesia, 200,000 from Surinam and 80,000 from the Dutch West Indies as a result of decolonisation. This was followed by substantial immigration from Morocco.\n34. Italy, having long been a source of emigration, gradually became an immigration country4, particularly after the dismantlement of Soviet Union. A period of \"Muslim\" integration was followed by non-Muslim integration from Romania and Ukraine. There are now some 2,300,000 immigrants with residence permits. This figure does not cover minors, for whom there are no records. The very high number of lawful immigrants is the result of the fact that numerous immigrants have had their situation regularised. The latest round of regularisation, which took place in 2003, saw between 600,000 and 700,000 illegal immigrants regularised. The figures reveal a demographic change in the immigrant population: men have brought their wives to Italy, thereby reuniting their families. Muslim women, however, are not likely to work, in accordance with their cultural traditions.\n35. Britain experienced large-scale immigration following decolonisation, and in the 1990s became a preferred destination for asylum-seekers. This was because conditions of admission to the country were relatively attractive compared with some other European states, in particular loose border controls, the fact that new arrivals did not need to produce certain administrative documents and the complete freedom of expression prevailing there. This situation became a sticking point with France regarding illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants wishing to enter Britain transited via France, in the hope of slipping across the Channel, but were usually caught and found themselves blocked in northern France, where they were housed in increasingly overcrowded reception centres, including the regrettably well-known Sangatte camp. Living conditions in Sangatte were very poor, and inmates had no chance of remaining in France unless they were granted asylum (but that meant satisfying the conditions). Yet settling in Britain inspired such great hope that illegal immigrants continued to be drawn in large numbers to northern France, at the risk of being consigned to these squalid camps and subsequently expelled. The situation was resolved only when Britain agreed to review the status of these would-be immigrants and to change its asylum and immigration conditions. The most recent statistics show a plunge in applications for asylum in Britain in 2003, with 61,050 cases registered compared with 103,100 in 20025.\n36. France's strong tradition of taking in immigrants and asylum-seekers is based on the prospect of their obtaining full citizenship. In 2002 France took in some 200,000 new arrivals, who came to stay, while 150,000 immigrants already settled in France were able to become naturalised and obtain all the rights available to French citizens. In the case of France, the immigration figures must be interpreted in the light of two specific legal features: jus soli, whereby nationality is acquired by virtue of birth on French territory, and the ease with which French nationality may be obtained. Thus, although the figure for the population of foreign nationality settled in France seems to have been stable for the last 50 years, at about 10% of the population, or some 5 million people, account must be taken of the 120,000 naturalisations that take place every year (the equivalent of the population of a city such as Rouen or Dijon) and the fact that French nationality is automatically granted to children born in France of foreign parents. Demographers have been able to establish that one French person in four has at least one grandparent of foreign extraction. If France had legislation comparable to that of the states that apply jus sanguinis, the figure for the proportion of immigrants settled in France would doubtless have to be doubled. Indeed, an earlier report presented to the Assembly stated that France accounted for 75% of immigrants of North African origin settled in Europe6. Quite apart from this steady immigration from its former colonies in North and West Africa, France is one of the main destinations of asylum-seekers not only from Africa but also from the Balkans, Central Asia and the Far East. France took in numerous asylum-seekers fleeing Vietnam after the Communist victory, the \"boat people\", whose quiet but outstanding success is a tribute to their courage and, at the same time, shows that communities with different cultures can live together harmoniously. There was then a rush of asylum-seekers from all the zones where there was conflict and poverty, from the Congo to Pakistan, not to mention the \"bogus\" asylum-seekers who migrate for economic reasons.\n4.2. Recent state of migration7\n37. Germany absorbs a massive number of non-EU immigrants, the great majority from Turkey. France also attracts twice as many non-EU as EU immigrants, unlike Luxembourg and Ireland. Germany is still attracting more Turks, Poles and Italians. France takes in large numbers of Algerians and Moroccans. Finland is gradually becoming an immigration country. There is also considerably intra-EU movement between France, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n38. As Europe enlarges, its borders are pushed further back, and what was previously extra-Community immigration is now becoming an intra-EU migration flow; at the same time, countries from Poland to Cyprus now lie along the borders of eastern and southern Europe will henceforth be facing a new type of immigration from eastern Europe, Asia Minor, and even the Far East and Africa.\n4.3. Causes of migration\n39. Having taken in tens of millions of immigrants arriving in Europe in search of freedom and possible access to prosperity, the Old Continent is now the destination of migrants from areas afflicted not only by economic deprivation but also by arbitrary government or indeed persecution and violence by dictatorships and/or terrorist groups. The only thing such prospective emigrants know about European civilisation is its apparent material success: they know nothing of the rules governing the functioning of our societies, drawing on the principle of equality and universal individual rights. Even more seriously, many of them have no desire to share such principles, which some go about defying or even combating.\n40. The causes of migration may be broken down into three main trends:\ni. demographic factors: differential population growth; high fertility rates, combined with high mortality rates, often compounded with one of the factors mentioned below, result in a migration flow which is vital for survival (the case of much of Asia, for instance, and Africa, with average birth rates of 7 surviving children per family, as in Nigeria);\nii. economic factors: underdevelopment, which happens when population growth exceeds economic growth, even where the latter is robust: this applies to immigration from the third world, with immigrants aspiring to a degree of prosperity inaccessible to them in their countries of origin;\niii. political factors: war, insecurity, oppression and ethnic and religious persecution.\n41. More and more emergency situations are due to famines, epidemics, tribal conflicts or terrorism. The most tragic problem, tragic because it should actually be the easiest to solve, is that of famines, given that they are often combined with other factors. The situation is exacerbated by the corruption of elites or warlords, who block the distribution of food aid, which is nevertheless widely available, or prevent it from reaching the actual famine victims.\n4.4. The economic and social consequences of migration in host societies\n42. The European context is difficult in that not only is industrial employment in decline, particularly owing to relocations, but also there is a huge influx of immigrants who have difficulty entering the labour market because they lack the requisite skills.\n43. Nevertheless, the consequences vary greatly depending on the host country and the immigrant population.\n44. As a general rule, unemployment rates among non-EU immigrant populations are much higher than among the indigenous populations, and this even applies to immigrants who have obtained their host country's nationality. Unfortunately, all too often severe discrimination in employment matters can be noted, although European legislation seeks to counter such practices.8 However, discrimination is sometimes difficult to prove, since employers rarely admit to it and cite other reasons for failing to recruit people of foreign origin. In some countries, particularly France, pressure groups are taking steps to test recruitment practices using \"anonymised\" CVs, which initially show neither the name, the place of birth nor a photograph of job applicants but merely state their qualifications and occupational experience, to assess the role which \"gut reactions\" on purely racial or ethnic grounds play in foreigners' recruitment difficulties. To overcome the ever-present problem of unemployment among immigrant populations it is also essential to bear in mind the vital importance of education: mastery of the host country's language and obtaining training, if possible in keeping with labour market demand, are prerequisites if the problems posed by an under-qualified labour force are to be avoided. This is naturally a message which can be conveyed more easily and more effectively to school children.\n45. Family reunion of immigrants from Muslim regions raises the same problems throughout Europe, as integration of women in the labour market and, more generally, in community life collides with tradition, which can also curb the integration of children, particularly girls. Fortunately, increasing numbers of Maghrebi women, for instance, are militating for reconciling loyalty to their original culture in the private sphere with the exercise of all their civic rights. Such efforts can succeed provided that the host State ensures that the universal rights secured for all persons present in the territory of the 46 member States of the Council of Europe under the European Convention on Human Rights take precedence over the influence of those who presume to regiment the immigrant \"communities\". As for immigration from eastern Europe, in Italy, for example, this mainly involves female immigrants, thus fitting in with a specifically Italian social, economic and cultural reality: most of these women work as cleaners, and especially as home helps. The Italian State has washed its hands of family and old-age policy: Italian families are becoming smaller and smaller, and family assistance is being farmed out to private companies to meet social needs.\n46. In most European immigration areas female labour centres on local unskilled service activities, at least for the first-generation immigrants. However, many young women of immigrant origin have achieved excellent school results followed by brilliant professional careers, provided that their cultural traditions do not bar them from the educational and training courses that provide the best qualifications.\n47. We must also consider the social costs of immigration. This is a tricky matter because we must avoid lapsing into caricature and prejudice. Admittedly we do have to combat illegal immigration, beginning by prosecuting the people-smugglers who take advantage of prospective travellers to Europe, showing utter disregard for the very lives of their passengers: no one can forget the 56 Chinese people who died of suffocation in a lorry on their way to Great Britain, the Africans who die while attempting to reach Spain across the Straits of Gibraltar, or the very recent case of the makeshift boats that left a few dozen survivors washed up on the southern shores of Italy, several dozen having drowned during a crossing that had cost them several thousand Euros, etc. Illegal work must also be discouraged, as it jeopardises the unprotected immigrants and distorts the labour market in the host countries.\n48. Although we must also combat the occasional abuses of the system, with some individuals attempting to live solely from social welfare without making any contribution to the host country's economy, once we have secured effective measures against illegal immigration and have successfully prosecuted the abuses noted, the funds expended on behalf of immigrants must be regarded as an investment which will eventually benefit all the host communities.\n49. This applies in particular to educational and medical expenditure. Not only will well-educated, healthy people \"integrate\" more easily into the national host communities, but also they will considerably enrich them. Another major side-effect is that they will less easily fall prey to the advocates of fundamentalism and rejection of Western standards, whose hate-filled word are fuelled by frustration. So the individual States must take account of these realities and plan the corresponding expenditure, including social welfare spending.\n50. Alongside the economic and social consequences of migration, there also arises the central question of immigrant integration in the host societies.\n5. Integration in the host communities\n5.1. Possible conceptions of integration\n51. A variety of conceptions of integration coexist within Europe. We must also look beyond our borders for other possible definitions of integration.\n52. A range of different policies have been implemented throughout Europe, and all these policies have shown their limits. Although we should bear in mind all the different approaches and possibly use them as a basis for our investigations, they cannot simply be transposed as they stand.\n53. We must fight shy of any attempt to standardise integration, and instead try to reconcile the various approaches to immigration depending on the traditions and legislation in force in the host States. The main distinction to be drawn is between assimilation of immigrants and communalism or multiculturalism.\n54. Assimilation - which is inconsistent with the values of the Council of Europe - confines cultural or religious differences to the private sphere and shuns any consideration of \"ethnic origins\". Individuals must blend into the national community. All members of society must share the same social blueprint and common values. They must accept the same laws and enjoy the same rights in accordance with the principles of equality and universality. The optimum indicator for assimilation is where the assimilated individuals' specificities are pushed into the background as a token of their renunciation of certain elements of their original culture and of their integration into a specific community of individuals.\n55. Conversely, under communalism, which we has never been accurately defined, the specific immigrant community becomes, to some minds, a value at least as important as the universal values of freedom and equality; others would define it as a socio-political project aimed at subjecting the members of a specified group to a set of rules deemed to be specific to this group9.\n56. According to its Latin origin, the concept of integration means \"bringing a part into a whole\". It is one of the essential functions of the social system, ensuring the co-ordination of the various sections of society with a view to guaranteeing the proper functioning of the whole system. For instance, we call a society well integrated if it has a high level of social cohesion, and an individual is deemed to be well integrated if he or she shares the values and norms of the society to which he or she belongs. By definition, integration involves all the interactions between the members of society, giving rise to a feeling of identification with the group and its values.\n57. In France, the Higher Council for Integration, set up in 1990, describes integration not as a medium term between assimilation and mere insertion but as a specific process prompting active participation in national society by a variety of different elements, while at the same time accepting the continuation of cultural, social and moral specificities and holding that the whole is enriched by such diversity and complexity. Instead of negating differences, a proper integration policy takes account of them without exalting them, and emphasises the similarities and convergences in order, with equality of rights and obligations, to establish solidarity among the different ethnic and cultural components of society and to enable everyone, whatever his or her origin, to live in this society, whose rules he or she has accepted and of which he or she has become a component part10.\n58. The United Kingdom has been seen as a laboratory for testing integration issues. During the post-war period, when the decolonisation process was providing an effective stimulus to immigration, the country was at first determined to assimilate these newcomers, granting them all civic, social and political rights on their entry into the national territory. Subsequently, after the first race riots broke out in the 1960s, the British Government noted that formal assimilation was not having the desired effect: it lacked a social strand, a real access to work. The UK definition of integration, as laid down in 1966, highlighted cultural diversity and equality of opportunity in a climate of mutual tolerance. The UK abandoned assimilation in favour of a new \"Race Relations\" concept: equal opportunities for all, against a background of cultural diversity and mutual tolerance, thus ushering in the multicultural era in Britain. For about a decade now, and more acutely since the turn of the millennium, this model has been under renewed scrutiny, the finger being pointed at the lack of values shared by all and of any real common feeling of \"Britishness\". This has been compounded since 2001 with the problems of combating terrorism. Large numbers of Muslim immigrants have been arriving in the country, giving rise to questions concerning their allegiance: with police action against terrorist plots and subversive \"sermons\" by certain \"religious\" leaders and the rise of populism and xenophobia, the United Kingdom is casting around for a fresh approach in integration policy.\n59. The German priority has been integration through the labour market, involving the trade unions and works councils. So there is a high level of unionisation, which makes for good working conditions: the unionisation rate for German nationals is 36%, with 50% for Turks living in Germany and 43% for other foreigners. Changes to the nationality law, which now combines the jus sanguinis tradition with some elements of jus loci, should encourage access by Turks, in particular, to German nationality, thus improving their chances of integration.\n60. Italy is apparently attempting to integrate its immigrants, although this attempt is unlikely to succeed in the long term: it periodically regularises a number of illegal immigrants, but stops short of forcing employers to re-recruit legally their former undeclared workers, thus promoting unemployment and maintaining the moonlighting mindset. Italy advocates the right to difference rather than assimilation.\n61. Moving on beyond the borders of Europe, we might take a look at the American and Canadian models11. They conduct an active and intensive policy in favour of a high level of immigration. The new arrivals find it difficult to adapt because of their origins: language, culture, religion and wide socio-economic discrepancies, reaching both ends of the spectrum (low standard of education and resources for some, and high qualifications and wealth for others).\n62. In 1971 Canada adopted an official multiculturalist policy. Training is provided in the official languages, the courses initially being confined to the workers themselves but subsequently being extended to their spouses and children. The State funds various aid agencies and runs reception programmes in order to provide immigrants with day-today support. However, aid policy still centres primarily on language assistance. Immigrants are entitled to integration assistance after one year's residence in the national territory. However, the plan to transfer specified powers wielded by the civil courts to community \"tribunals\" organised according to the specific standards of each immigrant group is causing some concern. For instance, Muslim \"tribunals\" would be able to apply Sharia law to Muslim communities, covering marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc. Given that Canada is a State that enjoys observer status with the Council of Europe, it is undesirable that it permit the implementation in its territory of standards which not only contradict the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights but above all negate the principle of equality between women and men, a field in which Canada was one of the pioneers.\n63. The United States of America traditionally takes a passive attitude to immigrants. From the outset there has been a clear determination to exclude individuals unable to provide for themselves, and so the State has never introduced any kind of assistance programme. Minor support programmes have gradually grown up, although no real resources have been earmarked for them. A radical reform of the welfare system was launched in 1996, leading to a situation where non-citizens have no access to social programmes until they have been in residence for at least five years.\n64. President Carter introduced an urban renewal policy in order to rehabilitate the major city centres, where the poorest groups are traditionally concentrated, ie Afro-Americans, Hispanics and new immigrants, and to promote a mingling of populations in both racial and economic terms. The various communities are being encouraged to integrate as both confidence-building agencies and driving forces for integration by improving economic and social living conditions.\n65. The United States presents a virtually unprecedented paradox: as a country created through immigration by European groups fleeing religious persecution, it has gradually taken in immigrants of all origins: Irish people fleeing the famine, Jews fleeing the pogroms of eastern Europe and Nazism, followed by defectors from countries oppressed by communism: Russians, Cambodians and Chinese, including their top scientists. There were also Cubans. Finally the \"economic refugees\" started slipping in across the Mexican border or took their chance with the Lottery which each year officially attributed tens of thousands of residence permits. The fact is that these groups show a striking attachment to their host country, the first glimpse of which for many of them is Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty looming over the entrance to New York harbour.\n66. The United States, no doubt anchored in this self-image as a refuge for people fleeing religious persecution, is, in principle, in favour of freedom for groups claiming specific belonging to a community, which freedom is enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution and the established case-law of the Supreme Court. The acceptance of independently organised groups, including those operating along ethnic lines, has probably been reinforced by the recent realisation of the extermination of the American Indians and the anti-Black discrimination which still continues a century after the abolition of slavery. From Indian reservations to affirmative action, successive American administration have therefore granted specific rights to these groups, which have been rechristened Native Americans and Afro-Americans.\n67. Nevertheless, a number of minor conflicts have demonstrated that common rules can prevail over specificities, even when they are presented as a religious cornerstone: the prohibition of polygamy among the Mormons, and the obligation for women to produce bare-headed identity photographs, regardless of any Islamic precepts to the contrary. The trauma of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks has, to put it mildly, weakened this tolerance vis-\u00e0-vis all faiths, as witness the drastic controls effected on entrance to the United States, extending to both prospective immigrants and tourists. The various communities' freedom of internal organisation, inter alia along religious lines, will no doubt remain, but nor is there any doubt that the experience of terrorism on US soil will lead to greater caution about any demands liable to undermine a nation which glories in the motto \"Ex pluribus unum\". This might in fact lead to a question American understanding of the European approaches to the problem.\n68. France is often presented as the model of anti-communalism, rejecting collective rights in favour of individual rights as a guarantee of equality and universality. French policy in this field has long been based on a desire to cut back on the \"ethnicisation\" of suburban areas. The French tradition of centralisation is unitarian in thrust and would therefore seem to militate against the development of any potentially divisive specificities. France has no racially oriented tradition, something which is precluded by its highly individual conception of secularism. Open references to race are difficult to imagine, and in fact these are only just beginning to see the light of day with the tentative emergence of \"positive discrimination\", under pressure from Mr Nicolas Sarkozy. However, there is a genuine desire to implement strong policies on immigration and integration, with respect for specifically French republican traditions. For instance, as Mr Nicolas Sarkozy pointed out at a recent colloquy on migration organised at the suggestion of our Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population12, French society has perfectly well absorbed successive waves of immigration in the past, inter alia from Spain and Portugal, which helped the latter countries to achieve economic stability and become major European States. This justifies the conclusion that the enlargement of Europe will not create any major risks in terms of migration flow. But it does not mean that we must refrain from controlling immigration. France has adopted this approach by reforming its asylum laws and legislation on illegal immigration, which will enable it to provide better facilities for lawfully settled aliens.\n69. Much can be learned from the integration experiences of the new EU member states. Although accessible data are still in short supply, there can be no denying that these countries too have faced problems of integration, or reintegration. The partitioning of eastern Europe after the Second World War created administrative borders that had little in common with the pre-war borders, within which people of the same ethnic origin had been grouped together. As a result, after the fall of the Berlin wall and the subsequent reorganisation, masses of people crossed the former geographical borders to regain their homelands and/or nations of origin. Their reintegration was not always easy, since they had sometimes developed very different behaviour patterns and attitudes depending on the regimes under which they had lived. The most striking example of such differences is naturally that of the two Germanys. The Hungarian experience13 in such matters is nonetheless worth noting, although it differs radically from the situation recently encountered in the EU's founder states: in Hungary the newcomers spoke the language and shared the host country's culture and history.\n70. In conclusion, it is important to note that integration is a dynamic process that can work both ways, each side deriving enrichment from the other's differences, as long as it takes place in accordance with the host country's traditional values.\n71. Obviously, any analysis of the concept of integration must include consideration of a phenomenon which often emerges alongside immigration, that is racism.\n5.2. Racism14\n72. Ever since the 1980s Europe has been facing immigration of a type no longer aimed at providing labour or strictly deriving from decolonisation. This new type of immigration was neither desired nor deemed necessary for economic reasons. This was the starting point for a feeling which sometimes escalated to the point of total rejection of persons, based on racial criteria.\n73. Racism varies in accordance with the individual country's history, culture and economic situation. It also varies according to the period in history. It is often combine with anti-Semitism.\n74. In the second half of the 20th century the racist phenomenon began to develop into something slightly more presentable and less obviously reprehensible. This \"valeting\" of racism derived from the immigration policies being implemented, from public support for various ostensibly acceptable theses, and from a swing towards acceptance of the exclusion of the Other, of those who are different.\n75. This meant defining the national identity with reference to a traditional hardcore made up of a shared history, culture and language, which is by definition inaccessible to anyone not born in the country in question. According to some theories, \"outsiders\" are even seen as a threat to the national identity, possibly presenting the nation with the need to defend itself. It is significant, for instance, that the building of mosques, which some regard as a sign of integration, demonstrating the will to stay in a given country while also freely exercising one's religion, as is traditionally provided for in national constitutions, is seen by others as a determination not to integrate, disavowal of the nation's traditional values.\n76. The media can also be a powerful intermediary for racism in that they can manipulate public opinion on the basis of facts often taken out of context, or else by overemphasising certain theories or offences which signally fail to reflect the loyal attitude of most immigrants. In 1985 in France, for instance, a high-circulation national newspaper terrified the public with a sensational front page headline asking \"Will we still be French in thirty years' time?\". More recently, a BBC commentator lapsed into some very unfortunate jibes against \"Arabs\", which led to his resignation but which had sufficient impact on public opinion for quite a few Britons to fall in behind him.\n77. With the current high level of immigration, there is a consensus that a system of immigrant selection will become necessary in European countries. Such selection must be accompanied with guarantees on non-discrimination15, or at the very least on a prohibition of any kind of discrimination that lacks objective, legitimate foundations such as possession of a given job specialisation or a specific qualification or diploma. The criteria for such selection should be completely transparent, reasoned and proportional. We must at all events welcome the reinforcement of legislation against racist comments and all forms of discrimination, as well as the strict application of the European Convention on Human Rights to all persons present in the territory of any of the Council of Europe States, whatever their nationality, gender or origin.\n5.3. How can integration be encouraged?\n5.3.1. By establishing genuine immigration policies\n78. In the past few years most European states have toughened up their immigration policies and strengthened the link between access to legal immigration and a commitment to integration on the part of would-be immigrants. Such a commitment, which is very often written into the law, is presented as an essential precondition for improving their administrative situation or acquiring additional rights. In some countries, the granting of a residence permit is conditional upon signing an \"integration contract\".\n79. In Denmark, for example, the law of July 2002 stipulates that a permanent residence permit and the related social benefits may not be granted until after a period of seven years of legal residence in the country, instead of three years previously. This permit is issued subject to passing Danish language, culture and history tests and a written undertaking to \"comply with local legislation\". Furthermore, Danish nationality is granted only after nine years of legal residence in the country, as compared with seven years previously.\n80. In Austria, the new immigration act, in force since January 2003, requires newly arrived non EU nationals or those who have been living in the country for less than five years to sign an integration contract under which they are obliged to learn the national language and familiarise themselves with national customs. Immigrants who fail the examination twice may have their residence permit withdrawn. Furthermore, knowledge of the German language is now compulsory for the acquisition of Austrian nationality.\n81. In the United Kingdom, but also in the Netherlands, all newly admitted immigrants must now participate in an \"integration programme\". In the United Kingdom, as well as having a command of English, immigrants must know how institutions work and show an understanding of British culture and civic life. They must take a citizenship test prior to integration. \"Citizenship ceremonies\" are now held at which applicants swear allegiance to the Queen and pledge to uphold the country's laws and democratic values. Candidates for British nationality must sit a language test.\n82. In France, the strong tradition of taking in immigrants and asylum-seekers is based on the prospect of full acquisition of citizenship. France took in some 200,000 stable new arrivals in 2002. At the same time, 150,000 immigrants already settled in France were naturalised, thus gaining access to all the rights of French citizens. As in the other countries of Europe, however, such a policy cannot be maintained and extended unless it is accompanied by a clear distinction between legal and illegal immigration. Two new laws were accordingly passed at the end of 2003, one relating to the control of immigration and the residence of foreigners in France, the other relating to the right of asylum. Measures have been taken to make the requirements for obtaining a visa stricter, new penalties have been introduced for those who employ illegal immigrants, and the new offence of organising marriages of convenience has been created. At the same time, the asylum system has been unified around the OFPRA (Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons) in order to create better conditions for examining applications and reduce the time taken to complete the procedure, while at the same time enabling a larger number of applicants to be eligible for refugee status. The \"French model\" is also based on a distinction between the private and public spheres. In the former, all the cultural or religious traditions which link immigrants to their country of origin may be expressed, provided they respect the fundamental rights of individuals. In the public sphere, public services and schools in particular are governed by the principle of secularity, which has made possible the peaceful co-existence of groups who clashed throughout the 19th century, almost to the point of civil war, on religious grounds. This is no doubt one of the options that could be suggested to certain states which are deeply divided between ethnic and religious groups caught up in an endless vendetta, resulting in countless deaths and constituting a fatal obstacle to economic development amid the spiral of poverty and hatred.\n83. The European Union is tending to take over from its member states' national policies in order to ensure harmonisation of the law of asylum and the conditions for legally entering the EU area. The European Union supplements this approach through agreements with the \"close neighbours\". The Justice and Home Affairs Directorate deals with migration, among other things. It has been given new powers since the Treaty of Amsterdam. The question of integration has come to the fore at European level in the past two years. The aim is not necessarily that Europe should choose an integration model, but that it should adopt a pragmatic approach: identify good integration practices, in a context of respect for European values, while ensuring a balance between immigrants' rights and obligations.\n5.3.2. By combating forms of exclusion\n84. The causes of integration difficulties are complex and depend to a great extent on immigrants' cultural and social origins and the host society's political and cultural traditions. Immigrants very often observe cultural, religious or social traditions which differ from the democratic values upheld by the host state. The integration process is made even more difficult by the fact that, very often, the usual instruments promoting social cohesion, such as access to the labour market, to the civil service or to schools genuinely encouraging an ethnic mix and social advancement, are largely closed to immigrants.\n85. Today, in most Council of Europe member states, certain communities play little or no part in the social, cultural or political structures of the host society and feel that they are victims of economic and racial discrimination, and these groups are very often concentrated in areas suffering from social deprivation. Hence these communities live in isolation in their neighbourhoods and continue to observe their customs and their way of life, which they hand down to, and sometimes impose on, their children. The latter, caught between two cultures, feel out of place and question their identity. Faced with problems of social integration, immigrants, whether new arrivals or members of the second and third generations, react very badly to exclusion, by rejecting the values of the host society. This leads to a feeling of social malaise and very often to the development of delinquency, particularly among young people, and, concurrently, the development of extremism.\n86. Generally speaking, there is a lack of social cohesion if the state's authority is challenged, if the state's standards and values are not recognised or if individuals are poorly integrated into the economy. There is a social fracture when a minority as such excludes itself from the community. This kind of \"ethnic\" isolation encourages community domination of certain neighbourhoods, and even the rise of religious fundamentalism. This situation entails dangers because it generates social tensions and weakens social cohesion and democratic values founded on equality of rights, duties and opportunities.\n87. Most European countries have been confronted with violent demonstrations by young people living in sensitive urban neighbourhoods. Sociological research has shown that these protests are the violent expression of a desire for social recognition on the part of a population relegated to the fringes of society, frustrated in its aspirations by a public order viewed solely in terms of its repressive function. As a general rule, these protests express a demand for greater equality, integration and social advancement. Some neighbourhoods on the urban periphery are victims of agitation by individuals who exploit these frustrations and seek to impose their \"own values\" and oppose any intrusion by law enforcement officials. States must endeavour to combat these phenomena, of which the inhabitants of these neighbourhoods, in particular young immigrants, are the first victims.\n5.3.3. Through social responses to exclusion\n88. Lawful immigrants form an integral part of our societies and their effective participation in the state machinery is an essential precondition for guaranteeing lasting social cohesion. It is indeed undesirable that, by reason of their ethnic origin, certain population groups within a country should be lastingly excluded from some aspects of state affairs. The efforts to combat discrimination in employment matters are an example of what can be done. These efforts must be extended to many other areas, although, in the Rapporteur 's contention, it is not necessarily scandalous that some types of jobs (in the armed forces or the judiciary, for instance) should be the preserve of nationals. Nonetheless, this should not constitute a ground for excluding these population groups from jobs where nationality criteria are no longer justified (for example, in France surveyors must still be of French nationality).\n89. In a communication dated 3 June 2003, the European Commission suggested defining integration as \"a two-way process based on mutual rights and corresponding obligations of legally resident third country nationals and the host society which provides for full participation of immigrants\".\n90. Essentially, integration policies should be policies of encouragement, aid and support, integration being a long-term, voluntary process which is sometimes difficult and which often concerns the first and second generations. The support aspect concerns the learning of the language of the host country, education for children and vocational training for young people.\n91. Because it is a decision to belong, integration presupposes a policy to inform would-be immigrants about their rights and obligations. Everyone has the right to respect for their identity, but they are also under an obligation, whatever their traditions and customs, to respect the principles and law of the host state, and to recognise and display, through their behaviour, the fact that they belong to that state. Integration means respecting imported cultures and peoples' identities, provided they do not challenge the foundations of the host society's culture and their manifestations do not violate public order or other people's rights and freedoms. In this connection, we should welcome the recent decision by the European Court of Human Rights setting limits on certain demands based on religious traditions in the light of the need for protection of other people's rights and freedoms, of public order viewed as an obligation for the authorities to preserve public peace, and, lastly, the principle of equality between men and women.\n92. The state must see to the provision of economic, social and cultural conditions that facilitate the integration of new arrivals who have entered its territory legally and of immigrants who have been established for several years. Generally speaking, it is by regarding immigrants as persons holding rights and, where appropriate, able to acquire full citizenship through naturalisation, that we shall give them the opportunity to become integrated without abandoning their identity. The state must take appropriate legislative measures to fight all discriminatory practices and measures against immigrant communities, on grounds of racial, ethnic or religious origin, whether in terms of access to employment, working conditions or access to housing. Conversely, the state must punish all incitement to hatred on the part of any individual, even from an immigrant background. States must maintain their policies of social development in sensitive urban neighbourhoods and support the initiatives of immigrants' representative organisations, which play a crucial role in the process of integration and social cohesion. They must also develop curricula emphasising the concepts of citizenship, respect for differences, social tolerance and, most importantly, respect for the guarantees of the European Convention on Human Rights and for the principle of equality, particularly between men and women. They can encourage awareness-raising campaigns to promote intercultural dialogue. They can also highlight positive examples of social advancement in various fields, or examples of immigrants or descendants of immigrants who have held political office.\n93. States should focus particular attention on improving the situation of immigrant women by according them specific rights, access to education and the labour market and real respect for their individual freedoms in the context of equality between men and women, including protection from \"customs\" that are contrary to public order and to Council of Europe conventions. The achievement of equal rights offers prospects for development which will spread to the societies of origin, with which these women retain links: changes in the status of women are the key to development in emigration countries, with control by women of their fertility, their health and that of their family, and with the guarantee of education and, above all, literacy skills being passed on. Failure in these areas would encourage communities to turn in on themselves.\n5.3.4. Reconciling integration and the fight against terrorism\n94. This has been a crucial issue since the events of 11 September 2001. Europe is under serious threat from Islamist groups who threaten to carry out actions within its frontiers, as they have done in Munich, Paris, Berlin and, on 11 March 2004, Madrid. At the same time, Europe is under potential threat from population groups already present on its territory. This is because they may be faced with a choice between loyalty to a given group, in this case the host country and nation, and possible allegiance to the causes promoted by terrorist groups. It is espousal of such causes which is likely to seriously endanger the host state. That is why the policies governing border controls and controls inside Europe have been tightened. Such policies are essential, but should remain in line with the positions traditionally defended by the Council of Europe.\n95. When rebellions are fuelled by subversive groups with the aim of carrying out terrorist attacks, states have a duty, while complying with constitutional rules and the European Convention on Human Rights, to take appropriate precautions, including international police and judicial co-operation, in the interests of those immigrants who aspire to live in peace in their host country and who publicly distance themselves from the terrorist groups, with which, therefore, they should not be indiscriminately associated.\n96. It is important not to give way to hate. In many non-European countries, the fight against terrorism has led to the flouting of basic rights. Even in Europe, political leaders have a responsibility to refrain from the kind of discourse that would fuel racism among the population and detract from the effectiveness of existing integration policies.\n5.3.5. Co-development: aid to the third world with the long-term aim of discouraging emigration and encouraging immigrants to return to their countries of origin\n97. It has been accepted for decades that the wealthiest countries have a duty to contribute to the economic and social development of third world countries, notably by earmarking a certain proportion of their gross domestic product for this purpose: we are forced to conclude that this amount, despite representing only a small percentage, has never been paid in full; as a result, the beneficial consequences this might have had have not taken place. But there are other factors too, one of them being the failings of certain third world elites.\n98. According to some commentators, the aid which has nevertheless been granted has been a resounding failure because the countries which have not received any are now rising economic powers (China, and more generally, south-east Asia), whereas the countries which have been \"drip fed\", in particular the former colonies of European countries, are more than ever third world nations, experiencing situations of famine or war, or indeed recession, which were unheard of in the days of colonisation. In Africa, for example, GDP is lower today than it was in 1980.16 The aid granted sometimes falls over 90% short of the target. Worse still, aid programmes have very often hindered the reforms needed to adapt to changes in economic life, causing a lag in development which it is very difficult for these countries to make up.\n99. Aid policies have changed: they are aimed less at improving infrastructure than at promoting an institutional climate suitable for encouraging private investment and employment-creating small businesses: improved public order and security, education, health, more efficient public services etc.\n100. In this connection, the urgent need to help third world countries to fight the AIDS epidemic which is rampant there cannot be overlooked: it is one of the keys to their survival, and to ours.\n101. On the other hand, the development of micro-credit, which enables women, in particular, to set up businesses which will provide a livelihood for the whole family, has been a quite outstanding and heartening success, and should be continued.\n102. Lastly, it should be noted that some countries which have a large diaspora in another country, such as Morocco in France for example, have a real policy towards this emigrant population. In fact, Morocco has a minister responsible for Moroccans living abroad, whose duties include guaranteeing full citizenship to emigrants and involving the diaspora in the economic development of the country of origin.\n103. Co-development policies must be part and parcel of our overall approach to integration. Although co-development is not a factor which directly affects the integration of immigrant populations within our borders, it would be a good thing if it influenced migratory movements upstream, since, as we have seen above, something must be done to attempt to regulate these movements. Co-development is one means of doing so. By encouraging people to stay in their home country, naturally under conditions that are as consistent as possible with the Council of Europe's values, or inciting them to return there under such conditions, certain population flows towards our countries can be stemmed, while at the same time improving development prospects in other countries by avoiding a brain-drain of their most qualified young people.\n5.3.6 Towards a concept of citizenship?\n104. The countries of Europe remain divided on some issues: one of which is the concept of citizenship. Some are ready to enhance the possibilities for immigrants to acquire citizens' rights: this is the case, inter alia, in France with regard to social rights, since no distinction based on nationality is drawn in granting welfare benefits; such a distinction is in fact officially prohibited, as the administrative courts regularly point out, in that all persons resident in the country are entitled to minimum standards of social protection. Other states do not fully concur with this position and have introduced duration of stay and/or language proficiency requirements. Yet others would like to go further by giving immigrants more rights, moving towards full citizenship - in particular, and this is often a source of problems, the right to vote in all elections.\n105. This is still a very divisive issue. By officialising various levels of citizenship (local, regional, national, supranational or transnational), European law itself does not offer any quick solutions to this lack of consensus.\n106. Each state is jealous of its own concept of citizenship and would like it to either take precedence over others or be preserved for national use. However, some, albeit partial and slow, progress can be noted. France's example is quite telling in this respect: secularity and the concept of the \"French people\" are two particularly important notions in France and underlie much of French legislation. Nonetheless, after many unfruitful attempts, with the courts showing a considerable reluctance to change the case-law, bordering on stubbornness, it has been possible to amend the concept of the \"French people\". France long held back from ratifying the Council of Europe's Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1992. In 1996 the Conseil d'Etat even held that the charter was incompatible with the French Constitution. In the end France signed the charter in 1999, but did not ratify it because the courts set great store by the concept of the \"French people\", making it absolutely impossible to recognise the existence of minorities within French territory. In March 2003, Article 1 of the Constitution was at last amended, to the effect that the Republic remained indivisible but its organisation was decentralised. This reform, passed without any general debate, is a sign of some initial progress in the way France conceives nationality and citizenship.17\n6. Conclusions and recommendations\n107. In your Rapporteur's view, it is important to preserve the Council of Europe's fundamental values within its member states in the context of measures to be taken to promote the integration of immigrants.\n108. All the Council of Europe member states should therefore be reminded of what these values are, to provide them with a yardstick for assessing the legislation they are, or will be, implementing not only in the field of integration but also in that of the fight against terrorism or the fight against illegal immigration, since it has been shown that these form part of the same debate in the current world context.\n109. The Council of Europe's fundamental values - a commitment to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and individual freedoms, and the promotion of the European cultural diversity - should provide a common basis for all those who live in Europe, citizens or immigrants.\n110. Your Rapporteur gained the impression that the populations of the first 15 European Union member states had not yet gauged the full significance of the arrival of ten new countries last spring: in particular, better information would be desirable to ensure that these new populations joining the EU are no longer regarded by public opinion as immigrants from outside the community, but as fully-fledged members of the EU.\n111. In addition, all countries, and especially the new EU member states, should be encouraged to put in place and implement reliable instruments for measuring migration flows on their territory.\n112. The questions of immigration and integration should be the subject of an in-depth debate in all the member states so that all opinions can be heard, and not only the most extremist views, as is very often the case, in the absence of any marked political will in this area.\n113. The principle of controlling immigration should be established, in particular so as to avoid receiving a massive influx of immigrants which our labour market would be unable to absorb, particularly as a result of industrial relocation outside Europe. Indeed, it is inconceivable not to be able to guarantee new arrivals decent living conditions in terms of our own values.\n114. Measures to combat illegal immigration, mafia-type networks and human trafficking organisations should be extended to all the Council's member states.\n115. Inspiration should also be drawn from good practices observed in many member states, and it should be proposed that they be extended or adapted to the others. For example:\ni. an attempt should be made to achieve Europe-wide harmonisation of asylum law and controls on illegal immigration, drawing inspiration, for example, from the courageous and ambitious reforms carried out in France;\nii. provisions should be introduced requiring immigrants to complete a transitional period of residence in the country in order to qualify for a residence permit and social benefits, as in Denmark;\niii.. it should be ensured that immigrants learn the language of the host country and familiarise themselves with its culture, as in Austria.\n116. Steps should be taken to ensure that the authority of states does not come under challenge from, for example, fundamentalist movements: for instance by systematically balancing demands for respect for imported cultures and identities against fundamental principles such as those of public order, equality between men and women and recognition of the very foundations of the host state's culture.\n117. If public opinion in the member states of the Council of Europe is against immigrants, there can be no real integration. It is accordingly necessary to promote reliable, clear information campaigns, not liable to racist or xenophobic manipulation, concerning the issue of migration and the culture, traditions and integration problems of immigrants.\n118. Lastly, aid should be provided to help countries to retain populations who, previously, very often had no choice but to go into \"economic exile\", or encourage these people to return to their countries of origin in decent economic and social conditions.\n119. Similarly, where a former conflict area has achieved lasting stability and a regime in keeping with the Council of Europe's democratic values has been established, measures should be devised to encourage the voluntary return of immigrants from these countries to their countries of origin.\n120. In conclusion, although, in the current world context, your Rapporteur does not entertain any misplaced optimism regarding the question of integration, is not pessimistic in the long term about the ability of European countries to reconcile integration and the Council of Europe's fundamental values. As the history of Europe has shown, with time integration has eventually been achieved in the best interests of each population.\n121. It is sincerely to be hoped that the context of terrorism prevailing at present around the world is not long-lasting and does not irremediably damage the ability of individuals to accept others.\nReporting Committee: Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population.\nReference to committee: Doc. 9948, Reference No. 2883 of 25 November 2003.\nDraft resolution unanimously adopted by the Committee on 6 December 2004.\nMembers of the Committee: Mr John Wilkinson (Chairperson), Mrs Tana de Zulueta (1st Vice-Chairperson), MM S\u00f8ren S\u00f8ndergaard (2nd Vice-Chairperson), Jean-Guy Branger (3rd Vice-Chairperson), Pedro Agramunt, Mrs Lale Akg\u00fcn, MM Gulamhuseyn Alibeyli, Jozef Bernik, Akhmed Bilalov, Ms Oksana Bilozir, Mrs Mimount Bousakla, MM Ivan Brajovi\u0107, M\u00e1rton Braun, Christian Brunhart, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avuso\u011flu, Doros Christodoulides, Boriss Cilevi\u010ds, Mrs Minodora Cliveti, Mrs Elvira Cortajarena, MM Franco Danieli, Joseph Debono Grech, Taulant Dedja, Nikolaos Dendias, Sergejus Dmitrijevas, Karl Donabauer, Mats Einarsson, Mrs Lydie Err, Mr Valeriy Fedorov, Ms Daniela Filipiov\u00e1, MM Karl Theodor Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg, Andrzej Grzesik (alternate: Henryk Kroll), Andrzej Grzyb (alternate: Piotr Gadzinowski), Ali Riza G\u00fcl\u00e7i\u00e7ek, Michael Hagberg, Michael Hancock, Jim Higgins, Mrs Jelena Hoffmann, MM Ilie Ila\u015fcu, Tadeusz Iwi\u0144ski, Lord Judd, Oleksandr Karpov, Mrs Eleonora Katseli, Evgeni Kirilov, Andr\u00e9 Kvakkestad, Geert Lambert, Jean-Marie Le Guen, Younal Loutfi, Tito Masi, Jean-Pierre Masseret, Ms N\u00f3ra Nagy, MM Giuseppe Naro, Xhevdet Nasufi, Pasquale Nessa, Kalevi Olin, Pieter Omtzigt, Gheorghe Popa, Virgil Popa, Gabino Puche, Milorad Pupovac, Martin Ragu\u017e, Anatoliy Rakhansky, Marc Reymann, Branko Ru\u017ei\u0107, Ms Katrin Saks, Mrs Naira Shakhtakhtinskaya (alternate: Mr Bakhtiyar Aliyev), MM \u00d6ssur Skarph\u00e9\u0111insson, Luzi Stamm, Mrs Terezija Stoisits, MM Michael St\u00fcbgen, Mehmet Tekelio\u011flu, Mrs Elene Tevdoradze (alternate: Mrs Irine Kurdadz\u00e9), MM Vojtech Tk\u00e1\u010d, Tigran Torosyan, Mrs Jelleke Veenendaal, Mr Jos\u00e9 Vera Jardim, Mrs Ruth-Gaby Vermot-Mangold, MM S\u00e9rgio Vieira, Old\u0159ich Voj\u00ed\u0159, James Wray, Akhmar Zavgayev, Vladimir Zhirinovsky (alternate: Mrs Vera Oskina).\nN.B.

Support Groups\nComplementary Therapies\nEthnicity-Specific Resources\nYoung Women\nLesbian Resources\nMale Breast Cancer\nAdvocacy\nWomen Building Bridges\nWeb sites\nYou have to accept whatever comes,\nOnce you have completed your treatments for breast cancer (including surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, etc.), you will naturally want to \"get on with your life.\" Although each of us goes through the experience of being diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer differently, there may be some common issues that you will need to deal with either immediately or long after our treatment is over. Having an awareness of the possibilities puts you in a better position to know how to deal with them or where to turn for help if one arrives in your life.\nIn this section, as in the previous one, we have chosen to address some of the more common \"post-treatment\" issues which many breast cancer survivors may be concerned with. Along with the resources we list at the end of this section, you should talk with your doctor about any health situation that gives you concern.\nHORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY\nI have breast cancer and had been taking hormone replacement therapy. Should I continue to take it?\nYour doctor should advise you about whether to continue HRT (hormone replacement therapy) at the time you are diagnosed with breast cancer. Generally, hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.\nWhy would hormone therapy be given to women with breast cancer?\nResearchers have found a way to use hormones as therapy against breast cancer. This is different than HRT (hormone replacement therapy), which is given to imcrease levels of hormones (such as estrogen and progesterone) that are decreased in the body due to menopause.\nOne hormone therapy drug for breast cancer is Tamoxifen. By blocking estrogen, Tamoxifen can block the growth of cancer cells. If your tumor is estrogen receptor positive (called \"ER positive\") this may be a good treatment for your breast cancer. (Estrogen receptors are found in the nucleus or center of the tumor cell. The ER allows cells to use estrogen to grow). Tamoxifen can be used alone, with chemotherapy, or following chemotherapy. Tamoxifen is also being used to prevent breast cancers from developing. You may want to ask your doctor about this.\nLYMPHEDEMA\nWhat is lymphedema?\nLymphedema is the collection of lymph fluid that can occur in your arm and hand after your lymph nodes have been removed or damaged from your underarm area (axilla) during breast cancer surgery.\nWhat is lymph fluid?\nLymph fluid is a colorless fluid containing the white blood cells that fight infection and disease. Lymph fluid travels through channels of the lymph system throughout your body much like blood travels through arteries and veins.\nWhat are lymph nodes?\nLymph nodes are small, pea-sized organs located along the lymph channels. They are grouped in clusters. Their job is to trap foreign bodies such as bacteria or cancer cells to keep them from spreading throughout the body. The nodes are clustered in areas throughout your body such as underams (axilla), groin, neck, chest and abdomen. The ones in your chest and underarm are the ones that collect the lymph fluid from your breast. This is why they are often removed at the time of surgery.\nWhat causes the arm to swell after surgery?\nNot every woman's arm swells after surgery. It swells because the number of pathways for the lymph to drain from the arm are reduced by the removal of or damage to the lymph tissue during surgery or radiation therapy. Fewer channels to drain the fluid can result in collection of fluid in the arm (or swelling). The extent of lymph tissue removed or damaged relates to how much swelling you may experience. Swelling may occur weeks, months or even years after treatment.\nAre there any safety precautions I should be aware of?\nYes. Because the lymph channels and nodes have been removed (or decreased) on the side of your surgery, you must take extra caution to protect your hand and arm from injury, cuts, scrapes and insect bites. You may have less protection against infection in that arm. Some people wear a medical alert bracelet with this information on it. It is important to remind healthcare workers to avoid drawing blood and measuring your blood pressure on that arm. It is also recommended that you wear gloves while doing housework, gardening and other activities that may put your arm or hand at risk for injury. In addition, it is possible for lymphedema to occur years after you have finished your treatment; therefore, taking care and being aware are your two best keys to avoiding or managing lymphedema.\nWhat about using antiperspirant or deodorant under my arm?\nYou should not use deodorants or antiperspirants while you are healing from surgery on the armpit on the side of your surgery. Once you are healed, you may use either antiperspirants or deodorants. Some doctors may recommend use of deodorants only. You should talk about this with your healthcare team.\nWhat can I do about the swelling? Is it permanent?\nYou should talk with your doctor about this. Sometimes, elevation of the arm for brief periods throughout the day is adequate to promote fluid drainage. Other methods to reduce swelling include arm exercises and gentle massage that specifically promote lymph drainage. Your doctor should refer you to a practitioner who specializes in lymphedema treatment if you have a persistent problem with this. More severe cases may require use of pressure sleeves to compress the arm. Lymphedema can be a permanent condition in some cases.\nHow do I choose a lymphedema therapist?\nLymphedema therapists have a range of training options. The programs they attend vary in length. When you are choosing a therapist, you might want to consider how much training he or she has.\nThe programs include: LeDuc (6 days of\ntraining), Lerner (14 days), Casley-Smith(14 days), Academy of Lymphatic Studies (ALS; 14\ndays), Klose-Norton (15 days), Foldi (20 days), and Vodder (20 days; some programs teach\nVodder \"techniques\", but only therapists who\nAlso, see the listing of lymphedema therapists in North Carolina in this directory.\nWhat is Manual Lymph Drainage?\nManual Lymph Drainage is a massage technique used to improve the flow of lymph using light, rhythmic strokes. This therapy may be effective for the lymphedema that sometimes follows breast surgery.\nMENOPAUSE\nWhat is menopause?\nMenopause is the absence of menstrual periods due to reduced function of the ovaries. This can occur naturally with aging, or from damage to the ovaries. This naturally occurs in women beginning in their 40s and 50s.\nWill chemotherapy cause me to experience menopause?\nBefore menopause, your ovaries produce estrogen. Estrogen is responsible for your monthly menstrual cycle and reproduction. Some chemotherapy drugs interrupt (temporarily or permanently) ovarian function, which can result in early (or chemotherapy-induced) menopause. This type of menopause can be permanent and has the same effect on your body as naturally-occurring menopause.\nWhat are some of the typical side effects of menopause?\nHot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and irregularity or absence of monthly menstrual periods are the most common effects of menopause. Menopause is also associated with bone loss due to reduced calcium stores in the bone.\nAfter chemotherapy treatment, some women resume their menstrual cycle. If you do not, you should seek advice about calcium replacement and exercise to promote bone health.\nWhat can I do to manage side effects of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness?\nYou should discuss menopause management strategies with your doctor or nurse. For hot flashes, there are medications available; also, many people are beginning to explore the use of alternative therapies, such as soy products or herbs. You should check with your doctor before proceeding with this approach. You must always be cautious about the possibility of drug interactions when taking supplements or herbals in addition to medications.\nOther considerations include choosing loose-fitting, comfortable clothing and regulating the temperature control to suit your preference.\nVaginal dryness can be addressed through the use of lubricants prior to sexual activity. There are many products available without prescription to remedy this problem. Persistent vaginal itching should be investigated to rule out the possibility of infection (see also the section below on Sexuality).\nWhat is osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis or \"porous bones\" is a condition of decreased bone mass. Bone is living tissue that continuously undergoes breakdown and rebuilding (at a cellular level) as a normal body process. Peak bone mass is usually reached by age 38. After that, bone begins to lose mass as part of the aging process. As bone mass is lost, bones become brittle. Men generally lose 20-30% of their bone mass over their lifetime, and women generally lose 45-50% of their bone mass. Decreased bone mass can lead to an increased risk of bone breakage and disability.\nWhy is this important to me now, and what are the risk factors?\nAs a person receiving cancer treatment, you are at increased risk for osteoporosis. Risk factors for osteoporosis include:\nChemotherapy can interfere with your normal production of hormones due to its effect on ovarian function. Reduction or failure of ovarian function automatically places you at increased risk for osteoporosis. It is important that you discuss prevention and treatment strategies with your doctor or nurse.\nWould I know if I had osteoporosis? Can I be tested for it?\nEarly changes in bone density are usually painless. Most people dont know they have osteoporosis until they break a bone. That is why it is important to know the risk factors and to learn what you can do to prevent bone deterioration.\nTesting can be done for osteoporosis. First, you should have a thorough health history and physical exam to determine your risk factors for osteoporosis. Then, your doctor will discuss or recommend your having a bone mineral density test if you are considered to be at high risk. It is a safe, painless and non-invasive test. This establishes your baseline bone density and provides useful information in determining the best course of action for you.\nIn North Carolina, bone mineral density (BMD) tests are available in some pharmacies. The cost of measuring the BMD in the heel is generally around $30, and this correlates well with the trabicular (spine) bone. This test reveals very little about the cortical (hip) bones, so you will not get the whole picture. However, the test will give you a reasonable assessment and baseline information that you can take to your doctor to see if further testing is needed. The test takes about five minutes or less and is pain free. You can have this test done without a referral from your doctor.\nCan I help prevent osteoporosis from happening to me?\nYes. There are a number of prevention strategies that are recommended to reduce your risk for osteoporosis:\nAgain, your healthcare team should advise\nyou in regard to these strategies, but you should not hesitate to initiate this discussion\nwith them.\nSEXUALITY\nEvery womans image of their body and sexuality is unique. No two people have exactly the same response or feelings when they learn they have breast cancer. If a mastectomy is performed, this can be overwhelming and emotionally difficult for some women. For others, it is a relief to have the cancer removed. Treatment for cancer, such as chemotherapy, can cause physical changes that may interfere with a woman's sexuality.\nIn addition, breasts are a part of many womens' sexual identity. Breasts are symbolic of nurturing, sustaining new life and intimacy. The loss of a breast can be threatening to body image and sense of self.\nIf I have a mastectomy, will I be disfigured?\nMastectomies today are done to preserve muscle, so there is much less disfigurement than there used to be. It is very important that you discuss this topic fully with your surgeons. If you are interested in reconstruction, you may want to consider options regarding breast reconstruction at the time of your initial surgery. If so, you should be referred to a plastic surgeon for a full discussion of your options. In some situations, reconstruction is not advised at the time of your initial surgery, but can be done at a later date after all of your cancer treatment has been completed. Reconstruction can also be chosen years down the road.\nWhat if I choose not to have reconstruction?\nIf you wish to use one, external breast prosthetics (breast forms) are available to help minimize the visual alteration of losing a breast. There are many different options available to you. You might want to consider this, too, when deciding about surgery and potential reconstruction options. (Also see the section on Reconstruction in After the Diagnosis in this directory).\nWill my sex life be different after breast cancer?\nChemotherapy for breast cancer can sometime cause a woman to go into premature, or early, menopause. This can be difficult for a woman physically, emotionally and sexually. The symptoms of early menopause are sometime more severe than those that occur with natural menopause. These symptoms can include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and low sexual desire, as well as depression, anxiety and increased irritability. Other menopausal issues include increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis.\nAre there solutions to the sexual problems I might face?\nThe good news is that there are solutions for these problems. Hot flashes can be treated with specific drugs prescribed by a doctor. Some women also have found Vitamin E or soy products to be helpful.\nVaginal dryness can be improved by the liberal use of a lubricant such as Lubrin, K-Y Jelly, Ortho Personal Lubricant, Surgilube, Today Personal Lubricant or Astroglide. Replens, a vaginal moisturizer, can be used three times a week. Recent studies have found that both Estrace, a estrogen cream used vaginally, or Estring, a vaginal ring with slow release of estrogen, restore the vaginal tissues without increasing estrogen in the rest of the body. Ask your doctor about these options.\nPersistent, low sexual desire is sometimes treated with androgens. You can have your hormone levels checked and discuss this option with a doctor. Other ways of increasing desire are reading erotic literature or watching erotic videos. Almost all women who were orgasmic before cancer treatment can be so again although sometimes it takes relearning and practice.\nIf needed, doctors can also prescribe therapies that address other menopausal issues (depression, anxiety, irritability, increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis). Several new, improved therapies are now available.\nSee the publications and organizations in Resources below for more help with managing menopausal symptoms.\nHow will my spouse or lover feel about me after surgery?\nIt is very important that you discuss this with your partner. Open, honest communication about your feelings and theirs is very beneficial to your overall sense of well being and the intimacy you experience before and after treatment. Your healthcare team may include a social worker or psychologist who can specifically help you to address your feelings and fears regarding sexuality and intimacy. Your acceptance of your body changes will affect how others react to you. It is important for you to be open about your feelings to yourself and to your spouse, lover or partner.\nAlways remember that who you are has nothing to do with your breasts (although perhaps they may have played a part in your self-esteem or sexual identity prior to your surgery). You are special no matter what the size of shape of your body, and you deserve to be in an open, honest and loving relationship with someone who cares about you--and accepts you--because of who you are in your heart, mind and soul.\nI'm single and not in a relationship. How and when do I tell someone new in my life about my breast cancer and surgery?\nThis is not a question with any easy answers, but there are some things you can consider when you find yourself in a new relationship:\nRESOURCES\nOrganizations\nAmerican Cancer Society, Inc.

My parents picked me up from the airport and we made a mad dash for Taco Bell, where I finally satisfied my unrelenting craving for 2 taco supremes and a nachos supreme.

The only logical explanation for the delay is that, it is Bolivia. I have found that 'It's Bolivia,' is an excuse in itself for delays, cancellations, or overbookings of transport of any form. The only noteworthy event from the train ride was actually after it was over and everyone was collecting their baggage. Apparantly a lady had died during the ride, which was brought to my attention as the corpse was carried past me and tossed into the back of a van, as if she were unclaimed luggage. Sadly, the only people that seemed to think it was unusual were me and the other backpackers that had taken the overnight train. All of the locals seemed unphased by it. From Oruro, I only had a 3 hour bus ride to get to La Paz, which had been overbooked, but luckily I was already in my seat when someone came to claim it as theirs, showing a ticket that was identical to mine. I didn't budge.Continue reading \"Advenures in Transit\"\nPosted by msshell at 12:40 PM\nView/Add Comments (5) | Category: South America\nDecember 18, 2004\nPass the Salt Please\nThe Salar de Uyuni in southwestern Bolivia covers 12,000 square km, and is the worlds largest salt flats. About 30,000 years ago, the salt flats were covered by a lake called Lago Munchin. When the sea dried up, it left the Salar de Uyuni, which contains about 10 billion tons of salt. At its deepest point, the salt is about 8 meters deep. I wanted to visit the salt flats when I was in Bolivia in October, but didn't have time. So when my flight from Buenos Aires to Lima was cancelled, I decided it was a sign that I should make my own way to Bolivia and see them. I arrived in Uyuni after a 2 hour flight and about 14 hours of bus rides and organized a three day, two night tour of the Salt flats and some nearby lakes.Continue reading \"Pass the Salt Please\"\nPosted by msshell at 05:35 PM\nView/Add Comments (9) | Category: South America\nDecember 14, 2004\nFrom Seasickness to Altitude Sickness\nGetting from Buenos Aires to Uyuni, Bolivia, my jumping off point for the tour to the Bolivian Salt Flats was an adventure in itself. The flight from Buenos Aires to Salta was uneventful, and I only stayed one night there before leaving on a bus heading north to La Quiaca in the morning. The bus to La Quiaca was about seven hours long and not too bad of a journey, despite the sweltering heat on the bus, and my need to use the bathroom for hours but being afraid that the bus would leave without me if I went. For the first three hours, I sat next to a 12 year old girl named Cynthia who was hopping off in a little village on the way to visit her four brothers. It was good to practice my spanglish with her, and I taught her to count to ten in english. After she got off the bus, I befriended an Argentinian named Jose Luis that had spent six months in Mossuri studying geology and spoke English very well. His destination was La Quiaca also, and when I told him I was planning to cross the border into Bolivia and head to Tupiza, he was kind enough to offer to escort me over the border and make sure I find the correct bus to Tupiza (where I would then have to find another bus to Uyuni). The random kindness of strangers is always refreshing. I must make it a point to be nicer to strangers when I get home.Continue reading \"From Seasickness to Altitude Sickness\"\nPosted by msshell at 05:31 PM\nView/Add Comments (9) | Category: South America\nDecember 12, 2004\nAnd For My Next Act...\nSo here I am in Buenos Aires. I spent about 75% of my first two days here blogging about Antarctica. I also made a quick stop into the U.S. Embassy to get more pages put into my passport, since it is full, and I stopped into a travel agent to reconfirm my flight out of Buenos Aires. When I got to the travel agency, I found out my ticket had been cancelled, inexplicably. What the heck? I knew I was too lucky leaving Ushuaia not having a kink in my flight plans like most others did. I think it's a blessing in disguise though, because I really wanted to see the Bolivian Salt Flats, which is sort of on the way to Lima (where I need to catch my flight back to the States). Sooo... I'm going to make my own way to Lima and hopefully stop into the salt flats on the way!

The way back was also mostly \"smooth,\" although it did get pretty rough in the middle of the night on the second night. At about 1 am, I woke up to everything not nailed down on one side of the room flying over to the other side of the room, including a ladder and a chair. The violent rocking only lasted for a couple of hours, but all night, I was involuntarily moving in a sort of elliptical motion, like my whole body was revolving around some imaginary axes. I didn't really sleep that night, but at least I didn't get sick.\nPosted by msshell at 08:45 PM\nView/Add Comments (5) | Category: Antarctica\nAnyone for a Swim?\nWe had two more landings left before heading back across the Drake Passage to Ushuaia. After the morning wake up call and breakfast, we geared up for our landing on Deception Island. The \"deception\" of the Island is that it is actually an active volcano, which last erupted in 1970. The island is shaped like a ring because of its collapsed cone. We landed at Whalers Bay, where there are remains from the old whaling station that closed in the 1930s. I walked up and down the sulphurous smelling beach checking out the whale bones and some of the old buildings. I also walked up to Neptunes window, which is a low point in the crater rim, where there was a nice view of the beach below.\nPosted by msshell at 07:12 PM\nView/Add Comments (7) | Category: Antarctica\nContinental Landings\nThe next day we made two more landings, both on the Peninsula itself. After the excitement of the previous day, everything ran like clockwork. Delphin took us over in the zodiac to the first landing at Waterboat point, where two British researchers spent a year living in a shelter made from an upturned whalers boat in 1921. There is not much evidance left of the boat, its location is now covered in snow and nesting penguins under the Chilean Flag. Also at this location is the Presidente Gabriel Gonzalez Videla Staion, that is manned in the summer only. When we arrived, the four chileans had arrived only a few days prior and had just finished digging their summer home out of the snow.Continue reading \"Continental Landings\"\nPosted by msshell at 06:11 PM\nView/Add Comments (2) | Category: Antarctica\nPetermann and Lemaire\nLeaving Mikkelsen Harbor, we were already at a latitude of 63 degrees south. Of course, part of being that far south at this time of the year is that it doesn't really get dark. I woke up at about 3:30 am friday morning to the crunching of ice against the ship. Looking out through the porthole, it was light enough that it could have been mid afternoon on a cloudy day. I went up to the bridge to see what was going on, and found out we were still trying to continue south to get to the Lemaire channel, but the ice was building up. The crew was intently watching the ice. I stayed up there almost falling asleep on my feet for about an hour or so, until I decided to go back to my cabin and try to sleep. It was tough though, I kept getting up and looking through the porthole to see what was happening.Continue reading \"Petermann and Lemaire\"\nPosted by msshell at 05:01 PM\nView/Add Comments (7) | Category: Antarctica\nLET US IN!!!\nThe next morning, thursday, we were supossed to have our first landing, but when I woke up and looked out the window, it didn't seem very promising.

After breakfast, Laurie had a meeting in the lounge to talk about our position and what we were planning to do, which pretty much came down to \"try to find a way in.\" (map).The previous day we had been all the way down by Anvers Island and had to turn around after reaching the pack ice in the Bismark Strait. We sailed overnight back along the ice edge and tried to get in between Anvers Island and Brabant Island, but part way in had to turn around again because of the ice. So by the morning, we were still heading along the ice edge looking for a way into the channel.Continue reading \"LET US IN!!!\"\nPosted by msshell at 07:23 AM\nView/Add Comments (4) | Category: Antarctica\nLatest Comments\nKevin: My favorite pic in this series is you 'feeding' th...

        "articleBody": "4.4 Health of the environment\nEutrophication\nConcentrations in Welsh rivers of the main plant nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) are generally much lower than those found in the midlands and south-east England. There are correspondingly fewer perceived problems associated with eutrophication compared with lowland England. However, nutrient enrichment arising from sewage inputs and agriculture does cause water quality problems in all types of aquatic environment, affecting drinking water supplies, conservation interests and recreational uses.\nA number of water-supply reservoirs are regularly affected by blue-green algal blooms notably Llandegfedd, Wentwood, Cefni and Nant-y-Frith, with implications for water treatment and supply. Conservation interests are being affected at a number of important wetland sites on Anglesey, at Bosherston Lakes in south Pembrokeshire and at Llangorse Lake near Brecon. Eutrophication is affecting the survival of two endangered fish species: the gwyniad in Llyn Tegid and the arctic charr in Llyn Padarn. Blooms of blue-green algae can interfere with recreational activities at a number of waters, including Llysyfran Reservoir and Eglwys Nunydd. Despite the environmental safeguards to deal with the consequences of eutrophication specified in the Cardiff Bay Barrage Act, algal blooms are likely to affect recreational uses and aesthetic enjoyment within the impoundment.\nThe Wye below Hereford and the Loughor below Garnswllt STW have been designated as sensitive areas under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. In both stretches, phosphate inputs from sewage works have been shown to promote plant growth which may cause serious de-oxygenation during the night under conditions of high temperature and low river flow. Resulting low concentrations of dissolved oxygen have been implicated in fish mortalities on the lower Loughor in 1984, 1990 and 1995. Besides these designations, there are many smaller watercourses in lowland areas which are affected by growths of algae. These effects appear to be chiefly related to inputs of nutrients from agricultural sources and may reduce the survival of salmonid eggs and fry in heavily affected stretches.\nIn general, scientific understanding of the links between nutrient inputs and eutrophication in estuarine and coastal waters is much less advanced than for freshwaters. Nevertheless, eutrophication appears to be connected with periodic low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the Loughor and Dee estuaries. The impoundment created by the Tawe Barrage in Swansea is subject to blooms of marine algae, and the impoundment has already been designated as a sensitive area.\nHistorical records indicate that algal blooms in coastal waters have been a periodic natural occurrence. However, the concentration of blooms of Phaeocystis between Liverpool Bay and the Menai Strait in north Wales, around Aberystwyth and in Carmarthen Bay suggest an influence of enhanced nutrient inputs in these areas arising from sewage, agricultural run-off and industrial discharges. Concentrations of nutrients and algae in the Irish Sea have risen steadily since the 1960s, so this problem appears to be increasing. Foams and scums arising from blooms are aesthetically unpleasant, can be mistaken for sewage and give rise to numerous public complaints over bathing water quality.\nBlooms of toxic marine algae are relatively rare around the Welsh coast although blooms of the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium aureolum have been linked to fish and shellfish mortalities in Swansea Bay in 1989 and St. Brides Bay, Pembrokeshire in 1994. Other blooms of potentially toxic alga include the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense which has been recorded in the upper part of Milford Haven since 1995, and a bloom of Dinophysis was recorded within the Tawe impoundment in 1995. The former can produce Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and the latter Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning, but no effects on human health have been observed to date.\nSynthetic chemicals\nThe distribution of individual synthetic chemicals in the Welsh environment reflects their physical and chemical properties, and the way in which they are dispersed. The persistent substances are poorly soluble in water but soluble in fat. They therefore attach to sediment particles, accumulate in the fatty tissues of animals, and pose the greatest risk to animals at the top of food chains. In freshwater these are fish-or insect-eating aquatic birds and aquatic mammals, such as otters, and in the marine environment seals, porpoises, dolphins and seabirds are at greatest risk. Clearly humans are also at potential risk from the consumption of contaminated wild animals. The techniques for monitoring distribution and measuring the effect of these chemicals are difficult and expensive. Consequently only the apparent high priority chemicals have received attention so far, and techniques are still being developed for many groups of synthetic pollutants.\nPCBs\nPCBs have been found to be present in freshwater eel tissue at sites throughout Wales, but highest concentrations were found in the lower reaches of industrialised catchments in the south-east and north30. Aerial inputs derived from global sources may also be a significant route for PCBs found in dipper eggs (an insectiverous riverine bird) at remote rural sites31.\nIn the marine environment, contamination is related to past industrial production, use, disposal and subsequent transport with fine sediment. Marine sediments areheavily contaminated close to river mouths and docks in the Severn Estuary/Bristol channel, contaminated at offshore sites in the Severn Estuary and Swansea Bay, and slightly contaminated in the centre of the Bristol Channel32. Although fish from Cardigan Bay and the Severn Estuary do not appear to be seriously contaminated, high concentrations have been found in marine mammals from these locations. This appears to be evidence of high accumulation in predators at a considerable distance from PCB sources.\nDioxins\nThe greatest risk of contamination by dioxins/furans is near potential sources such as waste incinerators. The Welsh Office commissioned a study of dioxins/furans and PCBs in the environment around the high-temperature incineration plant of Rechem at Pontypool in 199133. With the exception of a localised area within 500m of the plant, measured concentrations of PCBs and dioxins/furans in the environment provided little evidence of levels of contamination any different from those encountered in similar areas elsewhere in the UK. The effects of this plant should not give rise to undue concern, according to accepted criteria and guidance on health effects for these compounds.\nPesticides\nOrganochlorine pesticides were used for a wide range of applications in Wales, sheep dipping and wool preparation being the main rural use. Use of dieldrin and DDT in the UK was banned in the late 1980s, but significant residues of these pesticides remain in eels from agriculture-intensive and industrialised catchments. In the marine environment they are still found in the fatty tissues of marine mammals, and an inshore Cardigan Bay sediment sample contained the highest level of dieldrin contamination of all sites in a national survey35. Pentachlorophenol was synthesised in Wales and is still found in the discharge from the manufacturing site, although production ceased many years ago. Residues remain in sediments surrounding the discharge, and a slight effect on the invertebrate community there is evident. The biological impacts of organophosphate and synthetic pyrethroids are covered in Section 4.2.\nPAHs\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that result from combustion of fossil fuels and waste material are found widely in industrialised areas, in road run-off and in marine sediments close to shorelines. Many are moderately persistent in the environment, but are broken down in fish and higher vertebrate animals. They can cause the same sorts of cellular effects as PCBs and dioxins.\nOrganotin\nUse of tributyltin (TBT) antifouling paint on boats less than 25m in length ceased in 1987, and the application and removal of such paints on boats of 25m or more became subject to regulation in 1996. Evidence of impact on the affected species (dog whelk) is limited to parts of Milford Haven and Holyhead harbour, close to current sources of TBT on large vessels35. Organotin compounds have been used in other applications and their well-documented endocrine disruptive effect may require further assessment.\nRadioactivity\nSurveys in Wales show that the average radon concentration in Welsh homes is 20 becquerels/cubic metre, equivalent to about half of the total radioactive dose received by the population36. Radon levels are higher than this average in parts of Glamorgan, Pembrokeshire, Radnorshire, Anglesey and north-east Wales due to the underlying geology. More extensive areas with high radon concentrations occur elsewhere in the UK such as Cornwall and parts of north-east Scotland. Raised levels of radon gas increase the risks of lung cancer and the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has advised that indoor radon above an Action Level of 200 bequerels/cubic metre should be reduced. It has been estimated that Wales has about 10,000 homes with radon levels above this level.\nIn June 1998, the Welsh Office announced a targeted testing programme for four areas at the highest risk from radon gas emitted by natural sources. Householders in these areas can receive detectors from the NRPB to monitor radon gas in their properties over a three-month period. The need for measures to reduce levels will then be evaluated. Grants to assist in this work may be available from local authorities. New homes are protected through the building requirements in high-radon areas.\nThe results of extensive monitoring of the effects of nuclear facilities on levels of radiation in the environment are reported annually by MAFF. This includes an assessment of the maximum exposure to radiation to humans from each source. For terrestrial sources, these assessments are generally based on concentrations in agricultural produce local to the nuclear facility. For aquatic foodstuffs, the assessment is based on concentrations in species commonly harvested for human consumption. The calculation of the dose received is based on consumers with the highest potential intake of the food in question37. The exposure from each of the nuclear facilities in Wales was a small percentage of the maximum limit (1 millisievert) for members of the public from artificial sources of radiation (Figure 4.20).\nMonitoring in 1998 of the impact of the discharges from Amersham in Cardiff established that there were relatively high concentrations of tritium in flounders (up to 50,000 bequerels/kilogram) caught near the effluent discharge from the plant and also in sediments within the Severn Estuary. Previously it had been assumed, in accordance with other studies, that concentrations in fish would be similar to that of ambient seawater. The finding that tritium could be bioaccumulated required a reassessment of the radiation dose to the critical group of fish consumers in Cardiff, and the 1997 figure of 3% has been revised to 6%. This is still a small proportion of the dose limit but nevertheless the unexpected bioaccumulation of tritium was of concern and resulted in a requirement for tritium discharges to be reduced significantly (see Section 5.7).\nA survey was undertaken in 1997 to determine the concentration of technetium-99 in selected animals and plants around the Welsh coast. Highest concentrations (1836 bequerels/kilogram) were found in brown seaweed at sites closest to the Sellafield discharge along the north Wales coast. Concentrations decreased southwards with lowest amounts present at sites in the Bristol Channel.\nThe highest concentration found in periwinkles in the same survey was 152 bequerels/kilogram. This is not a high concentration in relation to the risk to human health since consumption of 12 kilograms would result in a radiation dose of 1 microsievert, which is only 0.1% of the dose limit.\nAcid rain\nNitrogen now contributes 60% and sulphur 40% of the total acidifying input from atmospheric deposition in the UK. Some 40% of nitrogen deposition is oxidised nitrogen from the combustion of fossil fuels, while 60% takes the form of ammonia, mainly from agricultural sources within the country38. Impacts by acidification from nitrogen and sulphur emissions can be assessed by the critical loads approach, which shows where deposition rates of atmospheric pollution are high enough to cause environmental harm. This demonstrates that acidity critical loads for soils and freshwater systems are widely exceeded by the combination of nitrogen and sulphur deposition39, 40 (Figure 4.21).\nCuts in sulphur emissions have reduced deposition in upland Wales from 3050 kg/ha/year in 1984 to 2030 kg/ha/year in 1995. Cuts in emissions of oxidised nitrogen have also contributed to reducing the affected area, but substantial further progress is needed25. The effects of reductions to date are apparent in declining sulphate concentrations and slight reductions in the acidity of 77 streams surveyed in 1984 and 1995. However, these improvements have not yet led to biological recovery (Section 4.2)."

Let\u00e2s see what happens if and when the Ethiopians try to enter Mogadishu.\nThe other point is that this conflict isn\u00e2t a straightforward Islamist/Christian match up everyone seems to be assuming; or at least that the religious aspect of the fight ties in with traditional Somali irredentism from way, way back.\nIn Ethiopia the damage which [Ahmad] Gragn did has never been forgotten,\" wrote Paul B.

I think that Ethiopia\u00e2s main interest in this conflict lies in keeping Somalia weak, rather than putting an end to Islamism in the country. Meles Zenawi seems to be saying as much here:\nMeles has said he does not intend to keep his forces in Somalia long, perhaps only a few weeks. He has told visiting dignitaries that his goal is to severely damage the Islamic movement's military capabilities and allow both sides to return to peace talks on even footing.\nIt looks like it might be Eritrea's turn to make a move, though they may hold on to see whether more troops are sucked into the conflict."

But if these 'affairs' are unconsummated, are we still being unfaithful? Joanna Briscoe on a modern dilemma\nSaturday June 18, 2005\nThe Guardian\nInfidelity is defined purely by sex - or at least we think it is. One drunken shag with someone whose name you've forgotten and you're unfaithful; an unconsummated 20-year passion nurtured in secret and you're a model of monogamy. But outside sex, there is an arena of messy feelings for which we don't quite have a name - covert relationships that involve secrecy and guilt.\nWe are all emotionally unfaithful. Even the most fiercely devoted mind will occasionally, momentarily, wander, even if the body has little intention of following. These days it is much easier to compartmentalise aspects of our lives and, if we want, act on those impulses. Aided by a culture of long working hours, isolated freelance employment, almost universal access to ever-developing modes of communication, there is a whole new network of flirtation, a soundless, secret exchange of personal intimacies.\nArticle continues\n\"But then, through my work, I've got a friend with whom I have a big conversational thing - he's my closest friend and there's an area of life that he fills that my boyfriend doesn't, and so there's an intimacy to that. I do question myself about this; I have to acknowledge that my boyfriend wouldn't like it at all. The interesting question is, where do we draw the line? In a way, it's infidelity when you feel excited by the situation, when you feel unfaithful.\"\nLizzie, a caterer in her 30s with two children, counts herself as \"very happily married, and I definitely wouldn't want to have an affair, but life can be a bit humdrum. I always saw one of the fathers at my daughter's school, and I knew he was interested in me, and that excited me. I sat on it and thought, 'If it doesn't have to be physical, why not?' I can't be very friendly with him openly, so we had to find other ways of connecting. I did fancy him, but we've had one talk about sex and both said, no, we can't, that's not going to be part of it. The connection is something else; the secrecy in itself lends a flavour to it.\n\"So we text a lot, and talk covertly in public places. We email, and occasionally meet for a drink. I do feel guilty about it, but it makes me feel good, makes me feel I'm still eligible, still out there. It's been something I've been able to keep separate, my own little secret. Two of my friends know - and I only told them because they hinted that they were in comparable situations. I want to own something not harmful that's good for me. It did distract from my marriage a bit, to be honest - a couple of nights I slept in the spare room, because the text alert kept going and I thought, this is ridiculous. I don't think it's morally OK, and I've pulled myself back from it, as otherwise it would be all-consuming. I now think, my marriage is my marriage; this is something extracurricular. I personally feel the ultimate connection is sex, and I worry that if I did, it would be disappointing and there would be nothing left - and I wouldn't do that to my husband. But there's definitely something edgy and covert and beyond the realms of what's acceptable.\"\nAfter a certain age, an almost universal desire to settle down with the right person takes hold. Plato's image of lost souls storming about free-range until they slot together with their other halves remains powerful, even in an over-sexualised era where we obsess about adulterous celebrities. We still want to find The One. But, at the same time, The One may not be enough. We believe we shouldn't have to adhere to the constraints of our parents' putative lifelong mating. We want it all, and believe we're entitled to it all. We end up combining the best monogamous intentions with a whiff of rebellion against that very state. Pure monogamy is not quite in tune with our supposedly swinging, secular society.\nDavid Miller is the founder of Loving Links, an extra-marital dating service for \"thoughtful, attached men and women looking for romance\". \"Adults now don't want to grow up,\" he says. \"We're told that we should be having this, this and this, and we feel hard done by if we don't. It's also the case for the baby-boomer generation: we're all Peter Pans, and no one's yet sent us a letter saying we have to stop having fun and sex.\"\nThere is a compulsion for the attached to seek romantic, if not fleshy, liaisons as a licensed way to have something on the side. Websites such as Friends Reunited involve a sizable chunk of the population in one big adult sleepover, texting and emailing anyone they like or fancy the sound of. This is justified as mental relief, a reward for juggling partners with long working hours and last-minute children. And for living so unprecedentedly long.\nRobin, an advertising executive who has been sexually faithful throughout his nine-year marriage, maintains ongoing romantic fantasies. \"I think guys do all the time,\" he says. \"There's this notion that women like romance and men like raw sex, and I think that's not necessarily the case. People talk about sex addiction, but I think sex addiction is a kind of romance addiction. It's part of male desire - not a priapic need, but a need to be validated and adored and made to feel whole by someone's reciprocal gaze. It's people who come into your life on a regular basis - you build up a little bit of a crush on them, and the next thing you know, you can't quite look them in the eye and you've got a fantasy about them. I go to Pilates a couple of times a week, and there's got to be someone I've got a crush on at Pilates, someone my imagination lands on. In the class, in its wordlessness, there's something relatively intimate about it. There's a girl who's got a tattoo on her shoulder, she's got a good shape and is nice and probably in her mid-30s, and in another life I could see myself with her. I kind of identify with her. It's more a romantic thing than a lust thing, but with an element of lust.\n\"I'm very happy in my marriage, but if I don't have somebody I feel romantically towards outside it, then I feel there's something wrong with my life. I see it as perfectly reasonable, not a problem, because I think there's an absolute moral distinction between shagging someone else and having fantasies about someone else. It casts a spell on your boring daily life.\"\nI wanted to write about slow-burning emotional infidelity in my new novel, because profound longing is more powerful than swiftly gratified lust. A frisson of mutual recognition can develop into a fixation in which both parties are stroking each other's mind, an exchange charged with suppressed sexual desire. Close and frequent mental interaction can be intensely erotic. It is astonishing how quickly even the most monogamous can turn into tumescent fools, deleting messages, fantasising about torrid futures with people they barely know. The straitjacket of no-sex-allowed becomes an addiction in itself. \"Having a partner who's emotionally unfaithful is maybe more hurtful than one who's physically unfaithful,\" says Miller. Paula Hall, a relationships therapist at Relate, thinks of infidelity as a breach of trust. \"It's when you're sharing emotional stuff with other people that you should be sharing with your partner.\"\nAccording to a study last year by Dr Monica Whitty of Queen's University Belfast, online emotional involvement can have as much impact on an existing relationship as sexual infidelity. In her study of 234 participants, who evaluated hypothetical online situations, women were found to be more likely than men to view emotional infidelity as cheating, and also more likely to see online infidelity as harmful to a real-life relationship; however, others described the interaction as \"just a friendship\" and would not classify it as infidelity \"as there was no physical sex taking place\".\nThe online interactions studied ranged from mild flirting to cybersex, and Whitty found that people's definitions of fidelity varied wildly. \"The new technology and opportunities for infidelity are evolving together. Cyberspace is a safe place to flirt. With online infidelity, people see a fuzzy boundary between reality and fantasy. Our social scripts about what is acceptable behaviour online are not as clear-cut as they are offline, and there's more opportunity for betrayal now that we've got more people to choose from online. People work less on their own relationship; they tend to look elsewhere. Increasing numbers of people are now going to therapy because of online betrayal.\n\"The results of this study show that couples need to be clear what the rules are when it comes to online cheating,\" says Whitty. \"Emotional involvement, even without physical consummation, can be just as damaging to a relationship.\" Hall agrees: \"Generally, research says that there is more personal disclosure online than in a face-to-face situation.\"\nOne woman I know in her 20s regularly emails strangers, going out on drinking dates as a relief from the stresses of her relationship. Many of her friends take a similar approach to their romantic lives. We may be approaching an era in which heated romantic or sexual online relationships will be deemed acceptable, just as men have traditionally used porn while some partners turn a blind eye. The repressed British psyche is well suited to a form of communication at once intimate and detached. In news reports of the misadventures of David Beckham, the provocative texts he sent Rebecca Loos were given greater prominence than details of any alleged sex, the most secret flirtation unravelling in all its ungrammatical glory.\nCate, a lecturer who has lived with her girlfriend for four years, recently emerged from an obsessive but non-physical relationship with another woman. \"What was so dangerous,\" she says, \"is that we seemed to have an incredible meeting of minds. The more tangly and intricate the conversations we had, the more it seemed that we had to keep having them, that no one else thought like this. It's only now I realise that, because it was almost all through letters, emails and phone calls, I could ignore the fact that I didn't even physically fancy her, though I'd persuaded myself I did. It could remain an affair that was about to happen, which was incredibly exciting.\n\"I'd sit at my desk rigid with anticipation for the bing of my email; there was nothing like the thrill of an enormous, involved email from her. It was like a speeded-up 18th-century romance - we were courting while pretending not to, and the speed made it all more exciting and feverish. Because it almost all took place at my desk, it was very easy to pigeonhole: it was a marvellous, stimulating life of the mind with nothing to do with either the sex or the arguments I was having with my girlfriend. I didn't really feel guilty: it felt like this discovery of a soulmate that should be encouraged, and nothing to worry my girlfriend about. Even as it got more romantic - and it went on for nearly two years; it consumed me - there was a safety belt: nothing had actually happened.\"\nMore partnerships are now formed through the workplace than through social life. Most adults spend more waking hours with colleagues than with their partners, making meaningful, exciting and even intimate workplace interactions inevitable. The mind is a sex organ, especially for women, a fact that is overlooked in a body-fixated and anti-intellectual era. In the workplace and by email, inventive brains thrive.\nHall says this transformation of the workplace into one big touchy-feely melting pot of sensibilities has significant consequences at home. \"In terms of work, we all talk more openly: it's horribly American, but we're getting more and more into 'sharing' ourselves. The ethos of the workplace has changed a lot, too - there's more emphasis on self-awareness, on emotional intelligence and literacy, on teamwork, all things that are about building a community in the workplace. Increasingly, it's the right place to share more personal stuff. And then it can get dangerous.\" The office can be a sexy place.\nCarey, an events organiser, has been in a relationship for eight years but has formed a strong emotional relationship with someone at work. Her friends are similarly distracted. \"I've got a small group of friends. We've known each other for ever and we're all married or with someone. In the past few years, we've begun talking in a really excited, conspiratorial way about who we've got a thing for on the side. It reminds me of when we were in our early 20s. We've got children, we're older, but there's this wonderful excitement at having a mental crush, a fascination, a thing going on with someone you hope won't lead to anything. It's boring talking about your marriage, and somehow too revealing - you can't talk about married sex because it's too intimate. We talk about other people instead.\"\nSome would argue that emotional infidelity can actually help a primary relationship, but Hall disagrees: \"Just because chocolate makes you feel good, it doesn't make you healthy. There's a tendency to say, 'I'm getting my emotional needs met elsewhere, which cuts down my frustration with my partner.' Men have used that excuse for years to have sex.\"\nNames have been changed.\n\u00b7 Joanna Briscoe's novel, Sleep With Me, is published on July 4 by Bloomsbury at \u00a312.99.

        "articleBody": "Explaining loss of positions to a future employer\nBy Andrea Wolf, Globe Correspondent, 6/20/04\nAt the end of 2000, I was laid off from a job that I loved. The position was rewarding and the company was a great place to work. I was devastated and jumped at the first job opportunity that came my way. I wasn't thrilled with the job but I worked hard and was rewarded with salary increases, bonuses, and company perks during my three years of employment. Last month, I found myself standing in the unemployment line again. Although both layoffs were due to poor business climates and not performance, I feel embarrassed and discouraged. I have stellar references from both employers, including the managers who made the layoff decisions, but I am concerned about what future employers may think. I also wonder if I may be in the wrong profession since I have been dispensable to two employers. Do you have any suggestions as to how I can handle the interview process to put a more positive spin on the situation?\nFeatured Articles:\nThere are other ways to save\nBalancing Acts\nWelcome home, dear\nClimb\nHave a plan to fight workplace harassment\nThe Corporate Curmudgeon\nIs anyone really listening?\nJob Doc\nProve that you've changed\nTransitions\nFocusing inward\nView from the Cube\nMaking a case for naps\nWho's, What, Where\nThis week's promotions\nThe Job Blog\nKeep up to date with career news from around the web\nRSS XML Feed\n(What's this?)\nYou are faced with a common situation in today's job market. Many companies are downsizing and cutting strong performers like yourself. It is evident that you were highly valued by both companies.\nWhat is important for you to internalize is that your position was eliminated for business, not personal reasons. Remember to reflect on the key strengths and benefits you brought the company.\nYou raise the uncomfortable feelings of how to explain your job loss to a future employer. Prepare a ''reason for leaving'' statement. You want to develop a statement that is truthful and acceptable to your previous and prospective employer. Keep it short, factual, and positive. I recommend a three-part story:\nBackground: A brief and positive description of your role and responsibilities.\nFacts: The company faced an economic downturn and your position was eliminated.\nMoving forward: Therefore, you are looking to utilize your skills in a new position.\nAs a result of the layoff, you seem to be questioning if you are working in the wrong profession. It sounds like you jumped too quickly into your second job without evaluating the fit.\nConsider this as a good time to do some self-assessment. You can start by looking at the skills you most enjoyed in your positions and ask for feedback from colleagues. Then you could explore other interest areas through networking. Since you are at a turning point, you may want to consider career coaching so that you can make a good decision in your next position.\nIT workers may need to reevaluate careers\nI'm one of the many IT workers who have been out of work in my field for a very long time. I had not planned a career change as I enjoyed what I was doing. However, I'm really starting to wonder if it's time to think about doing something else. I just don't feel from what I read about outsourcing that the IT sector will recover. What are your thoughts?\nOffshore outsourcing is a growing phenomenon affecting technology professionals who remain underemployed or out of work, like yourself.\nAlthough some areas in IT are expected to rebound as the economy strengthens, outsourcing to India and Southeast Asia has caused great competition for existing industry positions.\nAccording to market research firm, Gartner Inc., business process offshoring is expected to reach $1.8 billion in 2003 on a global basis, representing a 38 percent increase from the previous year.\nTwo years is a long time to be out of work. Such a hiatus from the workplace is worthy of a serious reevaluation of your IT career. The field has been hit hard but there are some opportunities that are beginning to open up depending on expertise.\nAs a starting point, determine what skills you have that tap into the current market needs for IT specialists. If your skill set is valued, then you need to evaluate your job search strategy.\nAsk yourself: How and where did you deliver value in your previous job? What did you contribute that made your business group successful? How current is your skill base?\nIt's also worth exploring whether you have the required qualifications and skills the market demands. You may want to pursue further education or training to broaden your experience.\nWhat other skills and knowledge do you have? For example, do you have experience with administrative IT programs in project management, payroll, or accounting systems? These skills may help you present yourself to other industries. If you have an understanding of an industry sector and its technology needs, then that may be an advantage to you.\nI have seen many IT professionals who have thoroughly scoured the job market with no success and have decided to work as contract consultants or take project-based work assignments on a temporary basis. This allows employers some staffing and cost flexibility. Sometimes these assignments can lead to full-time positions.\nWith all the changes in the market, everyone needs to be current in their field. In addition, we need to understand outsourcing's impact on business. The nature of work is changing so dramatically that most economists haven't even figured out the implications yet. Although we see the trend of outsourcing IT jobs to some countries and a decrease in these jobs in the United States, it is unclear what the future holds.\nWith any change comes both risk and opportunity. IT professionals may need to focus on the career paths that globalization is creating.\nIf many programming positions have disappeared, consider developing skills in understanding and translating business processes and utilizing project management experience. Doing so might enable IT professionals to position themselves as the liaison for offshore development projects.\nTo be competitive, IT professionals can no longer rely on their technical expertise solely but need to have expertise in industry specific business practices. They will need to be able to translate business needs to IT practices.\nSome points to consider as you examine your career options:\nStaying, complaining won't help your career\nI will be leaving my current position in about a year. My annual review is in a few weeks. I recently discovered that someone hired five months ago started at a salary $1,500 a year higher than mine, even though we both have an identical job title and description. I was told by my headhunter when the job was offered to me that there would be no negotiation of salary, so I accepted the offer as it stood. There are multiple problems at work including rampant turnover, low employee morale, and favoritism on the part of the office manager. Do I ignore the salary imbalance and just say ''good riddance'' to the job when it comes time to move on? Do I confront the office manager during my annual review and ask about the disparity in salaries? Do I contact the firm's human resources manager and discuss the disparity with him? Do I contact him now or wait to see what is offered at my review?\nYou may want to reevaluate your plan of staying in your present job for one more year. Why are you waiting to leave if you detest your boss and see both an unequal salary as well as limited future growth potential? If you are holding on for one more year in hopes of a higher salary, don't hold your breath.\nYou do not describe any positive actions you have taken. I wonder what efforts you have made to work more effectively with your boss. Remember, you were hired to provide skills that help your company and it is your job to meet your boss' needs.\nIf the differences are too great, then you have a choice: leave the company. To stay, complain, and hang in there demonstrates an attitude that will not help you progress in your career.\nRegarding the salary issue, you can always ask for what you think is fair in the negotiation with your hiring manager before accepting the offer. At this point, however, I think that raising the salary issue is a waste of your time and may create ill will.\nIn the future, be wary of a headhunter who says there is no negotiation. They are working for the company to fill the job and not necessarily for your best interests. Understand that negotiation is a natural part of developing a win-win situation with a future employer.\nI advise you to view your situation as a learning experience so that moving forward you can proceed at your professional best.\nBe upfront about need for flexible schedule\nI am looking for a 24- or 30-hour-a-week position, and I am considering applying for positions that are advertised as full time. My hope is being able to negotiate shorter hours, or do job sharing. My field is health services research. Positions are often grant-funded in this field, and I have been told that there is often room for flexibility in setting work hours. At what point in the application process should I disclose that I am seeking part-time work?\nThe field of health services research may allow for flexibility in scheduling, but my advice is go for the position as advertised so that you do not eliminate yourself up front. In the interview, you can ask about the job expectations to get a fuller picture of the position without hinting that you want part time.\nYour goal is to interview well, get the job offer, and then have a follow-up meeting where you can negotiate for flex time or reduced hours. Be prepared to share how you will get all the work done within that time frame and how you can be most productive.\nYou are at a much greater advantage to ask for changes after you have received the offer. Since the company offered you the position, they value you above the other applicants and may be willing to accommodate you.\nAndrea Wolf is vice president of career management at Right Management Consultants.\nNeed advice about managing your career or workplace?

Here's why that's not likely to happen\nUnder increasing pressure from conservatives, George W. Bush, a man not known as a penny-pincher, is seeking to make fiscal restraint a centerpiece of his fiscal 2005 budget. After three years of surging deficits, Bush is sounding like an old-school GOP budget hawk. \"With spending restraint and continued pro-growth economic policies, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years,\" he says.\nBush's Feb. 2 fiscal blueprint indeed proposes to cut the deficit in half by 2009. And, if it were adopted, it would effectively freeze funding for one high-profile chunk of domestic spending for the next five years. But critics argue that in the end, as they say in Texas, the President is all hat, no cattle.\nWhy? For starters, the budget does nothing to trim massive spending on entitlements, by far the largest chunk of federal spending. Instead, to hit his deficit target, Bush relies on a five-year freeze on the much smaller spending that goes into hundreds of domestic programs, such as law enforcement, environmental protection, housing, and education.\nFIVE-YEAR PLAN. Yet even that is largely illusory, given that Congress has never accepted that level of restraint. Even less realistic: The budget calls for no additional funding for Iraq and Afghanistan after Sept. 30, even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office figures reconstruction of the two war-torn countries could cost $50 billion and continued occupation will cost at least an additional $20 billion a year.\nPerhaps most misleading, Bush is offering up a five-year budget rather than the traditional 10-year plan. In doing so, he is hiding the long-term costs of last year's Medicare drug law, big future hikes in Pentagon spending for non-Iraq-related projects, and the impact of his latest $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan. Indeed, the President's latest plan includes the $990 billion cost of making his '01 and '03 tax cuts permanent as well as $300 billion in new subsidies for saving and buying health insurance. But less than 20%, or about $200 billion, of the revenue drain will take effect through 2009. The rest will occur in 2010-14 -- meaning ballooning deficits just past the horizon of the five-year budget estimates.\nSo how serious are Congress and the President about deficit reduction? Politicians will come to blows over a handful of fiscal matters in the coming months. Pay special attention to battles over two major bills -- one to build and repair highways, airports, and mass transit; the other a long-awaited energy bill aimed at providing subsidies to domestic producers with the stated goal of reducing reliance on foreign oil. And don't forget the fight over Bush's proposed tax cuts.\nCapitol Hill conservatives are putting heavy pressure on Bush to restrain spending even more than he has proposed. And, already, rising deficits have opened a major rift within the GOP. On one side, hardliners such as House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) see the deficit as a wedge into the issue they really care about -- shrinking the size of government. On the other, traditional fiscal conservatives such as Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me.) favor government spending for domestic programs but worry about red ink. Then there are the lawmakers whose main concern is protecting home-state projects. The GOP chairmen of both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are warning that they can't pass Bush's freeze.\nWith an election looming, most Democrats and many Republicans prefer to avoid chopping popular programs. \"It's going to be a very difficult budget year,\" says House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle (R-Okla.).\nThe first test of fiscal credibility will come when Congress acts on a massive six-year transportation bill. House committees favor spending $375 billion. The Senate is debating a $318 billion version. But the Administration warns that Bush will veto any measure that costs more than $256 billion. There is little chance Congress will O.K. less than $285 billion. So in any my-way-or-the-highway showdown with Bush, who has yet to veto any spending bills, bet on the highway to win.\nA second test will come once debate on the long-delayed energy bill starts again. Bush initially asked for $20 billion in production incentives. That has ballooned to $31 billion as a result of added congressional pork. The White House is trying to trim the measure. But unless lawmakers scale it back to $20 billion or less, it will be hard to claim fiscal discipline.\nThen there are taxes. There's no chance Bush will win approval of his full $1.3 trillion tax package. But GOP lawmakers will push to make permanent a fistful of middle-class breaks that were first adopted in 2001 but due to expire over the next few years. They include marriage-penalty relief, an increase in the child credit, and a temporary fix to the painful alternative minimum tax. But if Congress is serious about deficit reduction, it will have to ditch much of the tax package\nNICKELS AND DIMES? Already, legislators are looking at finessing the Bush budget. One strategy: delay key spending votes until after the elections. Another idea is to grant Bush's total $800 billion-plus spending request for all nonentitlement programs but shift funds from defense to domestic priorities. Congress would still give Bush the money he wants for the Pentagon -- but in a later supplemental bill of about $50 billion. In the yearend confusion, the President could take credit for holding down spending, while getting all the money he wants for defense.\nBut even if such a strategy succeeds in holding spending down in 2005, it is unlikely to have much impact on long-term deficits. That's because the programs the President wants to freeze represent barely one-fifth of the budget, making his newfound deficit concerns seem illusory at best. Environmental protection, crime prevention, and the like may be important to many Americans, but they don't cost much -- at least not by Washington standards. Of the $2.4 trillion that Bush would spend in '05, these domestic programs account for just $485 billion. \"This is not the problem,\" says Robert L. Bixby, director of the Concord Coalition, an anti-deficit group.\nThe real money is in defense -- which will cost nearly $428 billion next year, even without Iraq -- and the entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The big three will soak up a staggering $1 trillion next year. And, says the CBO, they will cost more than $1.4 trillion a year by 2010.\nTo put it another way, Washington will be arguing over a mere $10 billion in domestic programs. By contrast, Medicare spending will increase by more than twice that next year -- even before a costly new drug benefit kicks in. \"Spending will not be brought under control until entitlements are seriously reformed,\" says Heritage Foundation budget expert Brian M. Reidl. \"You can't nickel-and-dime your way to balancing the budget.\"\nNot that $10 billion doesn't matter. And fiscal responsibility needs to start somewhere. But Bush's budget -- and the likely congressional response to it -- will prove to be little more than election-year gamesmanship. It may help Bush, who could claim progress toward fiscal restraint. And it will allow lawmakers to campaign with new ribbons to cut. What the budget gymnastics won't do, however, is reduce the deficit by very much.\nBy Howard Gleckman, with Paul Magnusson and Stan Crock, in Washington\nBW MALL SPONSORED LINKSGet BusinessWeek directly on your desktop with our RSS feeds.\nBuy a link now!\nAdd BusinessWeek news to your Web site with our headline feed.\nClick to buy an e-print or reprint of a BusinessWeek or BusinessWeek Online story or video.\nTo subscribe online to BusinessWeek magazine, please click here.\nLearn more, go to the BusinessWeekOnline home page\nTODAY'S MOST POPULAR STORIES\nGet Free RSS Feed >>\nMARKET INFO\nStocks Rise as Oil Prices Fall\nCreate / Check Portfolio\nLaunch Popup Ticker"

        "articleBody": "Wooly Monkey Behavior and Vocalizations\nView the PowerPoint Presentation\nVocalizations\n& Displays in the Common Woolly Monkey\n(Lagothrix\nlagothricha)\nLindsey Hughes\nAbstract\nTwo troops of captive woolly monkeys were\nobserved with the aid of an 8 mm video camera and a proprietary Palm Pilot\nprogram. My research up to the\npresent will be continued, but with modifications in equipment and methods of\ndata. The two troops differ since\nTroop I consists of a family group with four members; the breeding male Corey,\nhis son Tomas and daughter Sara, and a non-breeding female named Sissi who is\nthe Coreys sister. The mother of\nTomas and Sara died while giving birth to Sara.\nTroop II consists of three unrelated males, with two more unrelated males\nwho are currently in isolation to be introduced in the near future.\nTroop I is one of only two captive family troops of woolly monkeys in the\nworld; the other is located in London, England.\nThe video recordings were analyzed\nframe-by-frame using a proprietary video digitization program.\nThe vocalizations were recorded by the video camera as well and analyzed\nusing Sound Forge to make sound spectrographs, or sonograms.\nA programmed Palm Pilot was used to record the movement and behavior of\nboth troops in order to make ethograms to display patterns of behavior and\nvocalization.\nThe following was anticipated: 1. vocalizations\nwould be correlated with visual displays; 2. display function would be\nidentified through context; 3 individuals would be identified through harmonics\nin the sonograms; 4. the behavior and vocalizations of the two troops would\ndiffer; and 5. the behavioral analysis would be useful for maintaining and\nbreeding captive troops.\nIntroduction\nThe common woolly monkey (Lagothrix\nlagothricha), also known as Humboldt's woolly monkey, is found only in South\nAmerica in the Amazon River Basin of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and\nVenezuela. They range in all canopy levels of primary rainforest as well\nas gallery forests, and have been found in mountainous areas and cloud forests\nup to 3,000 meters. The\nclassification of the common woolly monkey is as follows:\nTaxon\nClassification\nKingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum\nChordata\nClass\nMammalia\nOrder\nPrimates\nSuborder\nHaplorrhini\nFamily\nCebidae\nSubfamily\nAtelinae\nGenus\nLagothrix\nSpecies\nlagothricha\nThe morphology of the common woolly monkey is similar to that of other\nmonkeys in the Atelinae subfamily. The\nwoolly monkey is the largest monkey in South America, with the female weight\naveraging 11 pounds and the male weight averaging 15 pounds. They have a prehensile tail that can support their full\nweight and is used for feeding and locomotion.\nWoolly monkeys can have dark brown, pale brown, dark gray, pale gray,\nreddish-brown, or black fur. The\nlimbs, tail, and head are usually darker than the back, with the face being\nblack and the palms of the hands and feet being pink.\nSlight sexual dimorphism exists including the canines, body, and head in\nthe males being longer than females. However,\nthe female's tail is longer than the male's and the female's clitoris is longer\nthan the males' penis, which sometimes makes it difficult to determine the sex\nin the wild.\nHumboldt's woolly monkey is primarily frugivorous, but they also feed on\nleaves, seeds, flowers, and some invertebrates and small mammals. In captivity they have been known to prey upon birds that fly\ninto their cages. The group size\nfor woolly monkeys averages 10-12 group members, but much larger groups are\nknown to exist. Subgroups sometimes\nform and travel independently from the larger group.\nWoolly monkeys are not territorial and allow group ranges to overlap and\nhave been known to forage alongside each other as well as other species in their\nfamily. The woolly monkey travels\nthrough the forest quadrupedally using its tail as a fifth arm.\nThey rarely come down to the ground and, therefore, are known to be\nalmost totally arboreal. They even sleep 150 feet above the ground in the canopy.\nWhen on the ground, which is especially rare in the wild, they walk\nbipedally, using their arms and tail to balance.\nThe tail is extremely important and is always anchored to something; it\nis used to pick up objects and sometimes even allows the monkeys to rest by\nhanging from just the tail.\nThe social structure of the common woolly\nmonkey is a multi-male-multi-female group in which a hierarchy exists between\nthe males in the group. The\ndominance hierarchy is determined by play-fighting and age.\nThe species' mating system is polygamous because each receptive female\nmates with every male in the group, with the most dominant males receiving the\nmost copulations. Because of this,\nthe male that succeeds in passing on his genes is the one that releases more and\nbetter-fit sperm per session, with multiple sessions increasing the likelihood.\nTherefore, every male mates with every female, but only one female is\ncopulated with at any given time. In\naddition to receiving the most copulations, the most dominant males also receive\nthe most social grooming and are known to protect mothers and their infants from\nothers in the group. In general,\nadult and subadult males are dominant over all other members in the group.\nMale woolly monkeys are philopatric, which means that the males stay in\nthe group in which they were born, known as their natal group, while the females\nleave their natal group. Female\ndispersion usually occurs between the ages of five and a half years to six\nyears, the same ages that females begin to mate.\nAlthough females begin to mate between those ages, they remain sterile\nand do not conceive until one to three years after they leave their natal\ngroups. The gestation period\naverages seven and a half months, or about 223 days, and the female gives birth\nto one young about every two to three years during the birthing season, which\noccurs between the months of August and December.\nAfter birth, the infants nurse from sixteen to twenty months, traveling\nindependently by six months.\nLittle research on woolly monkeys exists, with the majority of the\nresearch focused on ecology, morphology, location, social structure, and so on.\nResearch on the behavior and vocalizations of the common woolly monkey is\nalmost completely nonexistent. The\nresearch on woolly monkey behavior and vocalization that has been done was\nperformed by M. Ramirez and published through the World Wildlife Fund in 1988.\nHis research was made into a \"dictionary\" that explained the\nbehavior or reason behind each vocalization, which he spelled out using human\nphonetics. He also explained some\nof the woolly monkeys' visual communication.\nAlthough thorough in some respects, his research did not investigate\nsequences of behavior and vocalization or analyze each individual separately\nwith respect to behavior and vocalization sequences.\nMethods\nMy research on the common woolly monkey was\nconducted at the Louisville Zoo, one of only two places in the world that have a\ncaptive family troop. After being\nformally introduced to the monkeys by the head veterinarian, I was able to begin\ncollecting data. Before starting\nthe data collection process, I decided to spend a few weeks observing the two\ntroops in order to become acquainted with the individuals.\nDuring the three weeks of strict observation, I took notice of each\nbehavior and began compiling a list of the observed behaviors.\nThis list is located in the results and discussion section.\nI also realized that not only could I tell the monkeys apart visually,\nbut vocally as well. After becoming familiar with the behaviors (displays) and\nvocalizations of the monkeys, I began collecting data.\nThe data collection consisted of a variety of\nmethods including the use of an 8 mm video camera to record behaviors, a mini\ndisk recorder to record the vocalizations, and a proprietary Palm Pilot program\nto record the movement and behavior of each individual in the two troops as well\nas the overall behavior of each troop. At\nfirst, I videotaped the woolly monkeys individually.\nThis method was not effective because the behavior of the other woolly\nmonkeys could not be seen and the monkeys move extremely fast and it is\ndifficult to follow them around the cage. I\nthen tried to videotape sections of the cage, but that did not work well either\nbecause I could not differentiate between the monkeys because of the cameras\nbad resolution. After four hours of\nrecording over one month, I realized that I needed a much better video camera in\norder to continue with the research. For\nmy future research I will have a video camera with superior resolution.\nThe video recordings that I had were used to learn and practice the\ndigitization process. The\nrecordings were digitized and transferred to compact disk for later analysis. The digitized version of the video recordings could be\nanalyzed at 1/10 of a second, with the potential advantages including the\nability to record the behavior at set intervals, allowing the viewer to record\nthe behavior of all the monkeys in view.\nThe mini disk recorder was used in conjunction\nwith the video camera. I\nexperienced multiple difficulties and problems with the mini disk recorder that\neventually led me to discontinue using it in this project.\nThis will be discussed further in the results and discussion section.\nBecause I did not have any vocalizations recorded, I decided to use the\nsound from the video recordings for my vocalization analysis.\nSound Forge, a computer program used for the sound analysis, enabled me\nto make sound spectrographs, or sonograms, on the woolly monkey vocalizations.\nIn order to analyze just the woolly monkey vocalizations and not all of\nthe background noise, adjustment was required. With Sound Forge, I was able to\ndelete all of the outside and background noise that included crickets, birds,\ntrains, human voices, and so on.\nThe proprietary Palm Pilot program used for recording the behaviors was\ncalled Pen Recorder and the program used to analyze the recordings was called\nPen Reviewer. Below are diagrams of\nPen Recorder, Pen Reviewer, and View Data.\nWhen\nusing Pen Recorder, I had to designate letters of the alphabet to the observed\nbehaviors. Once I started Pen\nRecorder, I wrote the letter of every behavior that I observed an individual\ndoing until they went inside or went to sleep.\nThis method was difficult because it was impossible to keep up with the\nbehaviors while having to remember which letter went with which behavior as well\nas write the letter and then keep going. The\ncollected data was viewed in Pen Reviewer under View Data, displayed above, and\nthen analyzed in the form of a graph, time line, and matrix, displayed below.\nAfter\nusing this technique for a while, I decided to change my method of recording\nbecause of the above stated reason as well as the fact that certain monkeys were\nmore active than the others and I had to start and stop recording for the\ndifferent individuals, which does not heed good results for analysis.\nFor my further research, I will be using a new method of recording\nbehaviors. Instead of using the\nproprietary Palm Pilot program, I will be using a tablet PC with a voice\nrecognition program so I can just speak each behavior as it occurs.\nResults &\nDiscussion\nThe individual woolly monkeys of Troop I each\nhave extremely different personalities, rank, age, relationships, etc.\nThe family troop consists of four related individuals:\nName\nBirth Date\nAge\nCorey\n11/13/91\n11\nyears\nSissi\n09/29/95\n7\nyears & 2 months\nTomas\n12/01/98\n3\nyears & 11 months\nSara\n12/07/00\n1\nyear & 11 months\nCorey\nSissi\nSara\nTomas\nCorey is the dominant breeding male and is father to both Sara and Tomas.\nSissi is Corey's sister and is the dominant non-breeding female.\nSissi has never had any offspring and is considered sterile.\nThe position of the second most dominant member of the troop is currently\nbeing fought over between Sissi and Tomas. Because Tomas is a subadult male and Sissi is an adult\nfemale, he and Sissi fight over everything, from food to where to sleep.\nThomas and Sara are siblings and fight and play in ways similar to human\nsiblings, but still show affection quite often, grooming each other and resting\nnext to each other.\nTomas and his father Corey appear to have the closest relationship within\nthe group. Tomas follows Corey\naround, mimicking certain behaviors. When\nTomas and Sara are resting together or grooming each other, Corey generally\njoins them. Strange to human\nviewers, the family troop members are sexual with each other, especially Corey\nand Tomas and Corey and Sara. Sexuality\nbetween family members is surprisingly common in the primate world.\nAccording to primate research, it is quite normal for a father and son to\nfeel on each other's genitals and have erections when around one another.\nThese behaviors are considered greetings and are meant to establish\nfriendly contact, usually occurring between adult males and juveniles of both\nsexes. During my observations, I\nnoticed that Corey and Sissi rarely interact, while the same is true for Sara\nand Sissi.\nThe monkeys in the family troop have differing personalities, with Corey\nas the alpha male. He is the\nlargest monkey, with huge canines and constant eye movement that indicates a\nneurological disorder, though not apparent in any other way. Corey never plays and is always pacing the cage, eating,\ngrooming himself or others, staring at outside disturbances, or resting.\nOnly after about a month of observation Corey appeared not to consider me\nan outside threat anymore, showing behaviors indicating a friendly greeting and\nthen calming down other group members through appeasement behaviors.\nThis meant that I could now observe their behavior undisturbed by\noutsiders. Tomas is more of a loner\nfor the majority of the time; shy toward outsiders, he never makes eye contact\nwith me, which is unlike all the others in the group.\nWhen not off by himself, Tomas is playing or play fighting with Sara,\nfighting with Sissi, or grooming or resting with Corey and/or Sara.\nCorey\nstaring Tomas hiding\nSissi & Tomas Sissi\nwalking\nSara eating\nfighting\nSissi is the most unsocial member of the group, only interacting with the\nothers when fighting with Tomas. She\nis, however, active toward me, cage shaking, which is a sign that she feels\nthreatened, and intense staring sessions at me, most likely indicating that she\ndoes not approve of my presence. When\nnot interacting with Tomas or me, Sissi rests high up in the top of the cage,\nfar away from everything and everyone else.\nSara on the other hand is the most active and social member of the group.\nSara is always doing something, whether watching me, playing with Tomas,\nresting with Corey and/or Tomas, eating, playing by herself with toys, or just\nrunning around bipedally on the cage floor.\nThe youngest, most curious and loving of the group, she is the one that\nhas tried to make contact with me the most and is the most affectionate toward\nothers.\nBelow is a table listing the observed\nbehaviors, their description, and the individuals in which the behaviors were\nobserved.\nBehavior\nDescription\nIndividuals\nIn Which The Behavior Was Observed\nEat\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nPlay\nSelf\nexplanatory; includes biting, running, climbing, rolling around, etc.\nSara,\nTomas\nChestrub\nRub\nobject against chest to scent mark; usually only done by males\nCorey,\nTomas, Sara\nSwing\nSelf\nexplanatory; on ropes or around the cage\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nWalk\nQuadrapedally\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nFight\nSelf\nexplanatory\nSissi,\nSara, Tomas\nGroom\nEach\nother or themselves\nCorey,\nSara, Tomas\nWalk\nBipedally\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nTeeth\nChatter\nDominant\nmale moves jaws up and down rapidly, chattering his teeth; threat display\nor sexual arousal display\nCorey\nJump\nSelf\nexplanatory; on floor, up to cage or rope, etc.\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nClimb\ncage\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nClimb\nRope\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nCage\nShake\nUse\nall four limbs to shake the cage; threat display\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara\nRub\nUse\nhands to rub on each others bodies; brings appeasement and strengthens\nclose relationships\nCorey,\nSara, Tomas\nBite\nSelf\nexplanatory\nSissi,\nSara, Tomas\nGrasp\nWith Tail\nUse\n5th limb to hold on to objects or pick up objects\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nStare\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara\nHump\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nTomas\nCopulation\nAttempt\nAttempt\nto copulate with another individual; practice for actual copulation;\noccurs between males and females and between males\nCorey,\nTomas, Sara\nRun\nSelf\nexplanatory\nSissi,\nSara, Tomas\nYawn\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nLick\nThemselves,\neach other, or various objects including the floor and the cage\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nMasturbate\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nTomas\nFeel\nOn Genitals\nFeel\non own or another individuals genitals; display of friendship and is\nthought to bring appeasement\nCorey,\nTomas\nReach\nFor Me\nSelf\nexplanatory; reach out of cage to try to touch me\nCorey,\nSara\nRest\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nSneeze\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nDrink\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nScratch\nSelf\nexplanatory; usually themselves\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nHang\nUpside-down\nwith tail grasping object and supporting entire body\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nReach\nOut Of Cage\nSelf\nexplanatory; usually to get leaves, sticks, or other food dropped outside\nof the cage\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nSit\nSelf\nexplanatory\nCorey,\nSissi, Sara, Tomas\nIn\naddition to using the video recording of the woolly monkeys for behavioral\nanalysis, it was also used for sound analysis.\nI used a computer program called Sound Forge, which enabled me to make\nsound spectrographs, or sonograms, of the woolly monkey vocalizations. In order\nto analyze just the woolly monkey vocalizations and not all of the background\nnoise, adjustment was required. Using\nSound Forge enabled me to delete all of the outside and background noise\nincluding crickets, birds, trains, human voices, and so on.\nI was able to produce several sonograms from the data collected by\nlistening to the sounds while watching the screen and marking where I heard\ncommon sounds of the woolly monkey. These\ncommon sounds included shrieks, squeaks, and grunts.\nI\nthen performed a spectrum analysis, an option in Sound Forge, in order to view\nthe vocalizations in the form of a sound spectrograph.\nAlthough this analysis is not yet complete, it will be continued in the\nfuture. After more spectrographs\nare made and analyzed, I will be able to differentiate between individuals just\nby looking at their sonograms because it is my hypothesis that each individual\nproduces different sound spectrographs although they make the same\nvocalizations. The human ear might\nnot be able to differentiate between individuals when they are making the same\nsounds as others so this data will be useful in further vocalization research in\nwoolly monkey populations.\nThe\nsound spectrograph below is of a squeak.\nThe next sound spectrograph is of\na screech.\nThe last sound spectrograph is of a grunt.\nFor\nmy further research, I will be using a new method to record behaviors. Instead of using the proprietary Palm Pilot program, I will\nbe using a tablet PC with a voice recognition program so I can just speak each\nbehavior as it occurs. The program\nis called Dragon records what I say and analyzes the data in a similar manner to\nthat of the proprietary Palm Pilot program.\nI will also be using an Elura 40 digital video camcorder, which has\nsuperior resolution and sound quality combined with the ability to take digital\nphotographs. The camera also has a\nsteadier that eliminates most of the shakiness from holding the camera.\nThe observation of Troop II will begin when the two new unrelated male monkeys are introduced to Monkey Island. I will continue recording more vocalizations and perform more in depth analysis using Sound Forge. This research will be helpful in teaching zoo personnel and others interested in woolly monkeys about their behaviors and vocalizations, as well as being useful for maintaining and breeding captive troops."

        "articleBody": "Reproductive Behaviour of Fishes\nDid you know that fishes embark upon courtship behaviour that leads to pairing and spawning? Many people are totally unaware of this. The courtship of fishes in not as complex nor as varied as that of men and women, and the courtship of fishes is not complicated by innuendos, hidden meanings and cryptic signals as in Homo sapiens. Rather, courtship in fishes, as with birds, mammals and other animals, comprises sets of recognisable signals, following set sequences which for fishes, provided the partners are physiologically ready, culminate in spawning. Courtship behaviour of fishes might be a simple set of signals and answers or it might be very elaborate and complex, depending on the type of fish. However, the signals are always easy for potential mates to read. Indeed, it is easy for biologists to read and interpret these signals.\nAmong the most interesting and best known to aquarists is the elaborate courtship of cichlid fishes. Typically a male develops a territory which he defends from all intruders. Many species also build nests, which might be elaborate sand castles, or excavations with tunnels or burrows, or may simply be a cleaned part of the rocky or sandy area in which the territory is held. Once the tasks of developing a territory and building a nest are complete the male is ready to invite females to his nest to spawn. Eager males may attempt to do this even before the nest is complete, but they are nearly always refused as the female does not get all the correct messages if the nest is not there. One of the reasons for this is that part of the courtship ritual includes the nest, and each nest type is species-specific; it is a characteristic of the species that is important to mate recognition and the acceptance of the correct partner.\nThe initial invitation is side-shake during which the male approaches a female, extends his fins and flexes so that the anal fin, which usually has attractive spots and colours on it, towards the female. If the female is interested the male then turns away and facing the spawning site beats its tail in a movement inviting the female to follow (follow-shake). If the female is still interested, then with exaggerated, undulating movements the male leads the female to the spawning site (lead-swim). Once in the nest or spawning site, the couple circle each other, perform a variety of shakes (nest shake, vertical nest shake etc) and gently nudge each other till the female lays eggs. The female then picks up the eggs in her mouth, sometimes doing so before the male has had time to fertilise them. This would be a waste of eggs, so to solve the problem the males of many species have dummy eggs on the anal fin. This fin is spread out in front of the female to display the egg dummies and curled slightly to hold spermatozoa that he will release. The female tries to pick the egg dummies from the male anal fin and in doing so collects spermatozoa, that fertilise the eggs in her mouth. The need to collect the eggs before they are fertilised arose from the fact that eggs are often stolen almost as soon as they appear by other fishes which feed upon them. Another problem is that males that do not have territories, and were not chosen as mates by the female, try to sneak spawnings by darting down between the spawning couple and fertilising eggs that are exposed. By collecting the eggs promptly, the efforts of robbers and sneakers are largely circumvented.\nOnce in the mouth the eggs develop into young fish that remain there until they are ready to feed for themselves. Most cichlids will then look after their young for sometime (a few days to four or more weeks), taking them into their mouths when there is a threat from predators. The fry are also taken into the mouth at night for safekeeping. Once the fry are independent they leave the care of the mother. Some cichlids behave as cuckoos; they give their fry to another species to care for. It seems that the foster parent can recognise the foreign young, but she is unable to chase them away or swallow them as both activities will endanger her own brood. Chasing foreign fry that are mixed tightly in a school with ones own fry is not possible without chasing away the own fry too. Similarly, how does the mother swallow foreign fry and not her own?Submitted by: Dr Tony Ribbink\nEmail:A.Ribbink@ru.ac.za"

        "articleBody": "|The things you're searching for.|\nDecember 10, 2003\nNapster paved the way, but the most popular file-swapping software of all time is KaZaA, which this year overthrows Dragonball to stand as the number one search term of 2003 with Web users.\nSince Napster was introduced in 2000, there have been a succession of file-swapping software programs. At all times, there was always one program that dominated the others in searches. First it was Napster, which ended as the #3 term of 2001. When the government took Napster down, that led to the rise of Morpheus, the #5 term of 2002. Then Morpheus had troubles and was replaced as the dominant software by the capitalization-challenged KaZaA and its spyware-free cousin, KaZaA Lite.\nKaZaA shot up the Lycos 50 in mid-2002 and ended last year as the #64 term of 2002. This year, it spent 15 weeks as the number one search term on our weekly list and only dropped out of the top five for two weeks during the Iraq War when The Lycos 50 was dominated by war-related search terms. During 2003, KaZaA received twice as many searches as all other file-swapping softwares put together. Only one other file swapper, WinMX (#86), makes the top 100. Napster falls from #49 to #165, while Audiogalaxy, which was #74 for 2002, falls out of the top 500 terms.\nDragonball falls from two straight years at #1 to the #3 spot, and in between comes the resurgent Britney Spears at #2. Actually, Britney had fallen out of the weekly top ten by the middle of 2003, but in August she climbed back to the top following a succession of publicity stunts generating oodles of queries from curious Lycos users. Between her topless photos on the covers of Elle Magazine (U.K. edition) and Rolling Stone, her bottomless photo on the cover of Esquire and most significantly, her kiss with Madonna (#84) during the MTV Video Music Awards, Web users were searching for Britney one more time.\n2003 was also a very significant year for huge stories that dominated Internet traffic for weeks at a time. The two biggest stories we have tracked since we began the Lycos 50 in 1999 were the September 11 terrorist attacks and the 2000 election and recount, but the next three biggest events -- if you count searches over a two- to three-week period -- all occurred in 2003. They were the War in Iraq (#15), the rape allegation against NBA star Kobe Bryant (#6), and the Paris Hilton sex tape. (#4)\nMarch and April saw Lycos inundated for searches related to the war. This was a more conventionally fought war than the one in Afghanistan last year, and for the first time in history people could follow the news of the war in real time through the Internet. In particular, people at offices without access to television used the Internet to keep up to date on the latest news. The Internet also significantly changed the way people followed the Iraq War because of the availability of foreign news sources offering differing opinions of the actions taken by the United States. Lycos users searched for newspapers from around the world, such as Le Monde, Arab News, and The Jerusalem Post.\nBy far the most-searched news source from outside the United States was the Arabic Al-Jazeera cable news network. Whenever information is not available through conventional news sources, we've found that Internet searches multiply, and this is what happened when the video of American prisoners of war captured in Iraq became available through the Al-Jazeera website. For a brief period in 2003, Al-Jazeera searches were three times more popular than searches for sex.\nThe desire to find information not given by conventional news sources also drove many of the searches in July and August that made Kobe Bryant the highest-searched male of 2003. During these months, over half of the searches for the Kobe Bryant rape case searched not for Bryant himself but for information about the name and biography of his accuser. These searches demonstrated a major dilemma for high-profile sexual assault cases in the Internet era. With so much information available online, and so little policing of what sites are publishing, no high-profile rape victim can count on remaining anonymous. Major news organizations kept the woman's name and picture private but independent websites and radio talk show hosts revealed this woman's name and stories about her past that may or may not be true. The accuser actually finished the year as the sixth most-searched woman of 2003, with more searches than Anna Kournikova (#37), Christina Aguilera (#25), or Madonna, but only one of six searches asked for her by name.\nThe end of 2003 has been dominated by celebrity scandals like the Prince Charles rumors (#156), the Michael Jackson (#73) arrest, and, most significantly, the Paris Hilton sex tape. Interest in the debutante party girl had been growing gradually all year, and she finally appeared in the Lycos 50 for the first time in October. But once the homemade video of her having sex with ex-boyfriend Rick Solomon was released on the Internet in November, searches for Hilton exploded. It's just the latest example of how search activity goes sky-high whenever someone we don't expect to see naked appears naked, or is rumored to be naked, on the Internet. During the second week of November, Paris Hilton and the sex tape generated more search activity than all of the search terms from number two through number 15 combined.\nOn the entertainment front, the significant development of 2003 was a higher-than-usual number of stars who seemingly came out of nowhere to take prominent places in pop culture. Actually, in the case of Clay Aiken (#24), one star literally came out of nowhere. In January, Aiken was a 24-year-old just out of college and working with the mentally disabled in North Carolina. By midsummer, he was one of America's biggest musical superstars thanks to American Idol (#30), and for the year he finishes as the third most-searched male on the Internet behind only Kobe Bryant and rapper 50 Cent (#18) -- another star who never received searches until late 2002.\nWhat's most astonishing about Aiken's popularity is that his fan base, perceived as consisting of teenage girls, actually consists primarily of women aged 30 to 50. Those teenage girls instead turned their attention in 2003 to two new musical stars, Canadian rocker Avril Lavigne (#51) and sitcom-actress-turned-singer-and-movie-star Hilary Duff (#61). Out-of-nowhere entertainment stars also included the Russian pop group t.A.T.u. (#39) and the goth-rock band Evanescence (#71).\nOTHER BIG BREAKOUTS OF 2003: Pop psychologist Dr. Phil, Atkins competitor The South Beach Diet, Japanese cartoon Inuyasha, maturing teen queens The Olsen Twins, wrestling babe Torrie Wilson, Jamaican dancehall rapper Sean Paul, porn star-turned-politician Mary Carey, rockers Coldplay, jazz-pop chanteuse Norah Jones, and celebrity dirt website The Smoking Gun.\nHOT IN 2002, NOT HOT IN 2003: all file-swapping software except KaZaA, the sex tape scandal of Asian politician Chu Mei-Feng, pop star Shakira, actor Josh Hartnett, Summer Olympics, toy and cartoon Zoids, rock bands Incubus, Blink-182, and System of a Down, Super Bowl commercials, and searches related to the September 11 attacks on America.\nWHERE ARE THEY NOW: If you are looking for tattoos, the term which ranked #3 in 2002 and #4 in 2001, we made an editorial decision in June to retire the term from the Lycos 50 after 200 weeks. The searches had become so constant that tattoos belonged on the list of generic subjects like lyrics and games that we don't include on our weekly list.\nONES TO WATCH 2004: There hasn't been a movie in years as controversial as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which is already getting lots of searches... Other hot 2004 films getting searches already include Brad Pitt in Troy, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Catwoman, which also should make Halle Berry a summer staple of the Lycos 50... Rock band Nine Inch Nails gets plenty of searches but has never made the Lycos 50; that should change when 2004 brings their first album of new material since 1999... Chad Michael Murray looks like the next hot teen heartthrob... The latest game in the Grand Theft Auto series is scheduled for fall 2004... Since female artists usually get even bigger once they go solo (example: Beyonce), expect big things from No Doubt's Gwen Stefani in 2004... A couple of previously unknown athletes become huge stars during each Olympics, and two U.S. names to watch are gymnasts Chellsie Memmel and Carly Patterson... Anti-impotence drug Cialis is hugely popular in Europe and is coming to challenge Viagra in the U.S.\nONES TO WATCH 2003: Our predictions for 2003 turned out to be quite successful. Daredevil boosted Jennifer Garner to stardom, even though the movie didn't do as well as expected. The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3 both made plenty of money. LeBron James went from high school prospect to the NBA player with the most-purchased jersey. Beyonce became a true R&B superstar with her first solo album. On the other hand, computer game Doom III was delayed and never came out, and actor Eric Bana went nowhere as star of The Hulk.\nKEEP WATCHING: That's not all for the Web's Most Wanted awards. Check the box on the top right for our other lists including top TV and movies, top men and women, and top fads, updated through December 18.

        "articleBody": "How do schools differ in grade configuration?\nSchools in the United States are organized in different ways: some schools include K-3, K-4, K-5, K-6, K-8, K-9, or K-12; others are organized as middle schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools; and still others consist of students in just one grade, such as a kindergarten center or a ninth-grade center. Some schools include pre-kindergarten. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (2002) provides data on the number of regular public school districts providing instruction and the percentage of students in membership, by grade span and by state, for the school year 2000-2001 (http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/2003310.pdf, Table 3).\nSingle-grade-level configurations\nThe literature suggests that some school districts have found advantages to schools that contain students at one grade level, although these advantages are not necessarily supported by research (Reents, 2002):\n- A single-grade center, such as a school only for ninth-graders, can develop programs specific to the needs of that age group.\n- Siphoning off students from several schools can relieve overcrowding at those schools.\n- Students may be able to participate on an equal level in more activities and be less influenced by older students.\n- The greater number of students in single-grade centers may enable the school to increase course offerings.\nThe literature also suggests some possible disadvantages to separate single-grade configurations (Hopkins, 1997):\n- The cost and length of student travel increases, particularly in a school district that covers a large area.\n- Parent involvement may decrease, possibly affected by the distance to the school and the number of schools a family's children attend.\n- Students are required to make an increased number of school transitions.\n- Fewer opportunities are provided for interaction between age groups.\nHopkins (1997) also suggests some additional factors for school districts to consider:\n- Combining schools into separate grade centers may affect whether neighborhood schools close or remain open.\n- Current buildings may have a design more suitable for several grade levels.\n- School population may increase or decrease substantially as configurations change.\nOther grade-level configurations: Middle schools, K-12\n\"Much of what has happened with regards to school grade structure can be attributed to the development of the middle school\" (Franklin & Glascock, 1996, p. 4). The separation of students in grades 5 or 6 to 7 or 8 in middle schools is justified by some school districts because districts believe that middle schools better meet the developmental needs of preadolescents. As Howley (2002) points out, the developmental needs of young adolescents differ from those of elementary school children and older teenagers. \"Developmentally responsive middle schools must take into account all that is known about young adolescents and the cultural context in which they live\" (Lounsbury, 1996). The number of middle schools increased by 35% from 1967 to 2000 (http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d01/dt095.asp).\nIn the past decade, researchers also have demonstrated renewed interest in schools that include grades kindergarten through 12. A study of rural schools that examined the relationship between grade configuration and student achievement in Louisiana found that students in K-12 rural schools did as well or better on achievement tests as students in separate elementary, middle, or high schools. Students in high poverty areas also did better in the K-12 schools (Franklin & Glascock, 1996). A similar study in Texas analyzed data from a study of 1001 Texas high schools, including 116 K-12 schools. This study produced similar results (Bickel, Howley, Williams, & Glascock, 2000).\nHow do grade configurations affect transitions?\nThe division of elementary schools into configurations that include fewer grades requires that students make several transitions from one school to another. Researchers note that transitions can be stressful for students:\n- Alspaugh (1999) found a significant achievement loss during each transition year. He also found that some students regain what is lost in the following year, but it would seem that students who make fewer transitions need fewer years to make up for achievement losses caused by transitions.\n- Another study found that each time students switched schools, their feelings of anonymity increased. Researchers who found that sixth-grade students in both elementary and combination K-12 schools outperformed students in middle schools or junior high schools considered the number of transitions a significant factor. This study considered 8 schools with 7 different grade spans with student populations of 82 to 1,200. The schools were located in both urban and rural settings in 5 northwest states. The number of grades in the schools ranged from 1 to 11 (Paglin & Fager, 1997).\n- Another research study found that girls in early adolescence suffered from a drop in self-esteem, extracurricular participation, and leadership behaviors when they made the transition into middle school or junior high, but not if they remained in an elementary school setting. This study found that the effects of this transition lingered throughout the school years. For boys, the study found similar negative effects in extracurricular participation and grades, but not in self-esteem, when they made the transition into middle school or junior high. The authors concluded that the relatively protected elementary school setting made the entry into adolescence less stressful for both boys and girls. The students who had not had the stress of the earlier transition seemed to cope better with the transition into high school than did other students (Simmons & Blyth, 1987).\n- Franklin and Glascock (1996) found that sixth-grade boys experienced more suspensions in middle schools or junior high schools than in elementary schools, possibly related to the effects of the transition, the school organization, or school size. This study was based on information gathered from all Louisiana public schools during the 1992-1993 school year.\nWhat factors do school districts consider when deciding on grade configuration?\nResearchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory looked at eight schools with seven different grade spans. They examined the history of each school's decision on grade configuration along with observed advantages and disadvantages of each configuration and principals' comments on the success of their programs (Paglin & Fager, 1997). Based on this research, Paglin and Fager compiled a list of nine factors that school districts might want to consider when making decisions about grade configurations of individual schools:\n- the cost and length of student travel, particularly in a school district that covers a large area\n- a possible increase or decrease in parent involvement, possibly affected by the distance to the school and the number of schools a family's children attend\n- the number of students at each grade level, which may affect class groupings and courses offered\n- the effect of school setting on achievement, particularly for grades 6-9\n- effect on whether the neighborhood schools close or remain open\n- the number of school transitions for students\n- the opportunities for interaction between age groups\n- the influence of older students on younger students\n- the building design-is it suitable for only a few or for several grade levels?\nPaglin and Fager concluded that designing a school system to use a particular span of grades in individual schools will not in itself guarantee that students will learn well and be well adjusted.\nReferences\nAlspaugh, John W.

Since this study was limited to a single school district that included all four elementary school configurations in communities that were found to be similar, variables that historically confuse the application of results to conclusions were systematically eliminated as causal factors. To study the effect of the remaining variables on student outcome, educational instructors that had experience teaching in both a K-2 and other configurations within the district were surveyed. The survey findings revealed the magnitude of the variance between causal agents known to affect future student success that exists in the K-2 versus other configuration elementary schools. In order of decreasing magnitude, the following variables are more prevalent in the K-2 environment than in other configurations, and their increased presence related to superior student achievement in later years: Resources, Parental Involvement, Collaboration (among administrators, teachers, and special services personnel), Foundation (ability to establish social and emotional competence, language, cognition, teaching strategies that lead to next levels of accomplishment), Relevant Teacher Training, Teacher Efficacy (with regard to aligning primary students' interests and abilities), High Expectations, Principal's Leadership, Teacher's Stability, and School Climate.

(BBB35873)\nAvailable from: EDRS Price MF01/PC02 Plus Postage.\nDocument Type: Reports--Research (143)\nGeographic Source: U.S.; Ohio\nResearch across seven very different states has shown that as schools get larger, the average achievement among economically disadvantaged students declines. A traditionally strong argument against smaller schools, however, is that they are too expensive. Large consolidated schools with narrowly specialized grade spans are typically offered as necessary to save money and to meet the needs of different age groups. This paper examines whether the size-by-socioeconomic status interaction effect proves robust across alternative regression model specifications, as it did across different states. It also explores whether the equity gains associated with smaller schools are incompatible with the need to save money. Analysis with four different regression model specifications consistently found that increased school size was related to increases in achievement-test-score costs associated with economically disadvantaged students. School size was negatively related to expenditure per pupil, but this relationship became increasingly tenuous as size increased, and eventually savings became negligible. In addition, organizational factors, especially as manifest in the distinctive components of the single-unit school, were related to cost reduction. For those interested in balancing expenditure per pupil with achievement-based equity, the best grade-span configuration seems to be a small single-unit school. (Contains 76 references.)

The larger the number of less advantaged students attending a school, the greater the decline. This study also examined the claim that large schools with a narrow range of grades necessarily save money by achieving economies of scale. Results indicate that school size was negatively related to costs, but this relationship became increasingly tenuous as school size increased, with savings eventually becoming negligible. In addition, analysis of organizational factors distinct to the single-unit school indicates that if schools are designed solely to minimize expenditure per pupil, the best configuration may be a large single-unit school. However, if expenditure per pupil is balanced with achievement-based equity, the best configuration seems to be one small single-unit school per district. While decreased size would increase costs, the fact that there is only one school with 13-15 grade levels would substantially diminish costs. (Contains 69 references.)

The booklet examines questions relating to grade configurations, its purpose being to increase awareness and understanding of the issues surrounding grade span. It explores the ways that schools have addressed concerns associated with particular grade spans and suggests avenues for further inquiry. The text focuses on historical trends in grade configuration and the various contexts of grade spans, such as whether a school is in a rural or an urban area. Most research on grade span focuses on the middle grades and addresses such questions as: Which grades should be grouped together in one school? How many grades should be in one school? and How many school transitions will students make during the K-12 years? Some tips for starting a school with a grade span new to a school system are offered, followed by an overview of grade-span considerations. The bulk of the volume describes eight schools' experiences with grade spans, discussing such issues as how the grade span came about and how the schools were structured to meet the needs of the particular grades it contains.

Of the 706 districts operating unit schools, 157 districts in 27 states responded to the survey. The majority of respondents (106) were superintendents of one-school districts, that is, districts in which the K-12 unit school was the only school. Of the 53 multischool districts, about half operated just one K-12 unit school. Data reveal that K-12 unit schools were usually located in an agricultural region where socioeconomic status was lower than the national average; the average unit school enrollment was 414; most unit schools in multischool districts were comparatively remote from key resources such as hospitals, interstate highways, and cities; superintendents of single-school districts reported higher rates of above-average test scores, postsecondary attendance, and high school completion than did superintendents of multischool districts; satellite and Internet systems were the most prevalent forms of distance learning technologies in use; community attitudes toward single-school districts were moderately and positively related to the sustainability of the school; single-school districts spent almost 50 percent more per pupil than multischool districts; and single-school districts more often than multischool districts employed cooperative strategies for maximizing resources such as joining regional service agencies or cooperating with other districts.

Results indicate that sixth- and seventh-grade students performed better in elementary and K-12 schools than in middle or secondary schools, in terms of both achievement and persistence. Students in K-12 schools performed as well as those in elementary schools overall and performed better in some cases (grade 6 and high poverty). For grades 9-12, the K-12 school was more beneficial to students than the traditional secondary school, particularly in the area of student persistence or conduct. With regard to academic achievement, secondary schools did not differ significantly from K-12 schools regardless of school size or SES. School size did appear to impact 11th- and 12th-grade student persistence more within the secondary school environment than that of the K-12 school.

Middle school advocates focus on early adolescents' need for developmentally appropriate institutions, but show only a weak historical understanding of the emergence and status of middle schools. Critical factors in early support for the middle school movement included urban interests in countering de facto school segregation without use of busing, urban overcrowding of elementary and high schools, and a \"bandwagon effect\"--the desire to appear modern and reform oriented. The emergence of rural middle schools under the cloak of psychological progress can be destructive to both the declining sense of community in America, and to the actual persistence of many rural communities still organized around K-8 or K-6 public elementary schools. Examination of the National Center for Education Statistics's Common Core of Data indicates that the construction of rural middle schools has led to the closing and consolidation of rural elementary schools. During the school years 1987/88-1991/92 the proportion of schools that were middle schools increased 20 percent in rural areas, was unchanged in suburban areas, and decreased 6 percent in urban areas. At the same time, the proportion of rural schools that were K-8 declined precipitously. Emerging school reform agendas that provide alternatives to the \"inevitability\" of consolidation include efforts to restructure schools as caring communities (requiring active parent and community participation), and the development of rural schools as centers for integrated social services.

The organization of the middle school (commonly the grades 6-8), however, is based on a philosophy of education that was specifically designed to meet the special needs of a preadolescent learner; middle schools incorporate unique curricula to better effect the transition between elementary and high school programs, rather than attempt to approximate one or the other. Many educators, perceiving junior highs as a \"failed\" promise, have turned to the middle school philosophy as an affirmation of a higher level of commitment. Indeed, since 1964, the number of new middle schools replacing traditional junior highs has progressively increased. A review of research on middle-level education indicates that: (1) although primarily an administrative concern driven by attendance boundaries, grade level organization had little impact on middle-level students' academic achievement; and (2) the terms \"junior high school\" and \"middle school\" do not define a school's program. Additionally, the effective schools research has given rise to discriminant analyses of effective middle school variables and allowed researchers to identify those characteristics most commonly found within \"exemplary\" middle schools.

This paper reviews literature and research regarding these trends, the advantages and disadvantages of both systems, and the effects of grade organization patterns on students. Particular emphasis is given to the middle/junior high school system. The paper concludes with suggestions for changing grade organization patterns. Appendixes include references, a chart showing secondary grade organization patterns, and an outline of advantages and disadvantages in the systems.

Because of the paucity of literature on this concept, the major part of the report focuses on the reorganization of the elementary schools of the South Allegheny (Pennsylvania) school district. Although the K-2, 3-5 structure is often implemented in response to declining enrollment, other educational benefits cited may include better concentration on the educational and psychological needs of children in the two age groups, though one research study showed no significant differences in student achievement, attitude toward school, extracurricular participation, or career aspiration. The goals of the South Allegheny reorganization (in response to declining enrollment) were to equalize class sizes to facilitate multilevel instruction in reading and math, and to make better use of staff, school buildings, and instructional resources. Each of these objectives is described in detail, along with perceived disadvantages. An evaluative report revealed that the new grade structure saved money and resulted in improved discipline, student attitudes, and student interaction. Finally, literature on the implementation process is briefly reviewed, emphasizing the need for clear articulation between grade levels. Notes and references are included.

        "articleBody": "[Editor's note: this article is now largely superseded by C Language Tutorial for Cocoa ]\nWhen you first start playing around with Interface Builder and prototyping some cool interfaces, it's easy to get excited about Cocoa's potential. If you've ever read an old-school book on Mac programming like Scott Knaster's \"How to Write Macintosh Software\" you'll appreciate the power and simplicity of just drawing your user interface. (If you haven't played around with these tools yet, check out Erik J. Barzeski's \"Two Lines of Code\" article for a gentle introduction.)\nCocoa's Interface Builder is even better than other \"visual interface\" toolkits like HyperCard, FaceSpan, and FileMaker's layout tools because what you create doesn't just try to imitate the feel of a Mac interface, it really is a Mac user interface. There are other toolkits on other platforms which offer this simplicity, but the Mac OS X developer tools will be the first time they have been freely available for all levels of Mac developers to use. In the past, I had tried unsuccessfully to master old-school Mac programming. Interface Builder was what convinced me that perhaps things were changing now and learning to program a Mac was an attainable goal for a scripter like me.\nThere was a big gap for me though. Apple provides some good documentation for learning Objective-C, but they didn't write anything about learning standard ANSI C. This omission is intentional and understandable. Apple doesn't provide developer documentation to teach you how to touch type, use the mouse, or perform other \"basic\" pre-requisites. So it looked like I was going to have to start out either learning C or Java before I could get to anything remotely Apple relevent like Cocoa.\nWhen I started, I wanted to learn Java. It was a language with a lot of industry \"buzz.\" It had huge class libraries already written. It had a syntax that was more understandable to my Hypercard and AppleScript roots than C did. And I really didn't fancy the idea of having to learn two languages (C and Objective-C) before moving on to what I was really interested in.\nI spent a lot of time finding good references on Java. If you want to pursue this route I highly recommend Bruce Eckel's \"Thinking In Java\" Second Edition (http://www.bruceeckel.com/TIJ2/index.html). It is one of the most readable and understandable introductions to Java, and ultimately it was why I gave up on the language for the time being. The book's CD-ROM includes a multimedia introduction to the C programming language and encourages the reader learn the basics of C from the tutorial before going very far into Java.\nThis seemed odd at first, but after moving through the C tutorial it really started to make sense. Learning C is a good foundation for Java (and Objective-C). The C language isn't terribly obscure or complex; it's a concise language that makes writing procedural code straightforward. And in both Objective-C and Java, when you get down to the level \"inside\" the objects you still must be able to program in a traditional procedural fashion that's vey similar to standard C.\nWhat I discovered after learning some of the basics about C was that Objective-C was a very simple step beyond standard C. Java has some nice features and, one day, I will go back and try to learn it. Java's wide assortment of class libraries, industry-wide acceptance (including WebObjects), and garbage collection scheme make me curious about whether it would be a better language to use. But for my learning purposes, Objective-C was a very simple step forward. If you already know Java, your decision will likely be different, but if you are as new to \"real\" programming as I am, you may find that Objective-C is the simpler path.\nAt first, I resisted even writing this section. C isn't terribly complicated and if you try to learn it on a \"need to know\" basis you probably won't really be learning it but just checking items off on your list.\nTo start though, you should learn how to write C, don't try to learn C by reading other people's code. I learned lots of scripting languages by reading samples and scripts of others, but this didn't work well for C. After people get the hang of writing C, they start taking shortcuts to make typing easier. When I was just starting out, I found that I ended up doing more decoding of these examples than actual learning. What was worse was that sometimes my decoding was wrong and I'd end up very confused. You'll be much better off following a tutorial and writing out your own code that is clear and understandable.\nAs for the topics themselves: You should learn about the different types of variables and how to change one into another when needed. You should learn some of the basic string functions like printf, sscanf and strcopy, but Cocoa includes a lot of great string manipulation so there's not a need to get too in depth about string functions and techniques. You should learn how to read and use the order of operations table but it's probably not necessary to commit it to memory. You should learn about the various types of loops (while, for, and so on). You'll need to learn about some of the more advanced structures like enums and structs. And you will need to learn what a pointer is and how it's used is a good thing, though you probably don't need to learn a great deal of pointer arithmetic or pointer tricks.\nOne topic that you may not want to get into (that many introductory courses cover) are the bit operations. Twiddling bits isn't something that's you have to do in Cocoa (but you can if you want). But I found the subject really helped me understand C better. Nevertheless, if your goal is strictly Cocoa and calculating in base two makes your head hurt, you're probably safe skipping the subject.\nLearning C takes some patience and attention. There are many books on the shelves and there are a number of tutorials on the Web that will help you.\nI recommend reading at least one of these books and doing the suggested exercises in it to learn C. Personally, I used all of them (in addition to some others I would not recommend), but that's mainly because I like reading different writing styles and perspectives.\nReviewing these books would be a huge undertaking itself, but here's an unjust summary of their use to me. \"The C Programming Language\" is the definitive guide to C but it can be a difficult introduction to the language; if I had to get only one book this would be it though. \"Practical C Programming\" gives some very good advice about C writing style and how to avoid writing \"unreadable\" programs. And the \"The Waite Group's C Primer Plus\" is very helpful if you aren't familiar with programming in any form (AppleScript, FileMaker, Basic, etc). I'd also suggest looking at some book review sites (like Amazon) for some opinions of what other readers thought.\nI'd strongly recommend buying real books to learn from. There's something about the editing and review process that made them more useful and lucid to me than the tutorials available on the web. But if money is a concern or you just want the convenience of having an online reference, there are some tutorials available on the world wide web.\nA word of advice though, don't cheat by cutting and pasting code into your practice programs. Just like your fourth grade math teacher prohibited you from using a calculator to learn your multiplication tables, you will learn C better by typing all of your code from scratch for each and every exercise. It's a pain, but the mechanics of the process is just as important as learning the logic. When you start making programs over fifty or a hundred lines long, then you probably will want to start taking typing shortcuts.\nComing from the world of Mac scripting, some of the conventions of C were confusing for me. Here's a list of a few of them. They may or may not make sense to you yet, but if at some point you get flustered or confused someone else may have been there too.\nThat about wraps up this topic. Be sure to look at some of the other tutorials for more information. In the meantime, get out there and learn C. Good Luck!\nThank you for the information and guidance your article provides.Posted by: Stuke on March 15, 2003 08:35 AM\nC counts from zero rather than one because it's just an offset from the base address of the array. Since the first element of array foo begins at the base address, the offset is zero, so we write foo[0], or *(foo+0), or *foo.\nThe next element is one away from the base address, so it is referenced as foo[1], or *(foo+1).\nAnother excellent book on C is \"Expert C Programming,\" by Peter van der Linden.\nIncidentally, Mr. van der Linden's \"Just Java\" book is a nice gentle intro to Java, but it needs to be followed by the already-mentioned \"Thinking In Java\" from Bruce Eckel, or at least the O'Reilly book \"Java In A Nutshell\" by David Flanagan.\nJava is such a great language (once one understands the whole CLASSPATH thing) because it's so easy to learn and to use (so it's great as a first language), and it's plenty powerful for real-world development.\nThat said, I use it only for server-side development. I never grokked the GUI side, and the Java GUI apps I've run were both slow and frustrating to use.Posted by: Glenn on May 6, 2003 04:24 AM\nI wrote a few C tutorials (\"Programming in C\" and \"Programming in ANSI C\") many years ago. Next month (Dec. 2003), my Objective-C tutorial, \"Programming in Objective-C\" will be released.\nI decided to teach the language from the ground up, that is, without having the reader learn C first. I did this so that the programmer can avoid learning procedural programming techniques before establishing a good foundation with object-oriented programming. Just because Objective-C is layered on C, it doesn't mean you have to learn C first!\nAfter learning how to program in Objective-C and use the Foundation classes (which I teach in the book), then I recommend the reader go back and learn more of the details about C (such as arrays, functions, and pointers). These are covered in the book, but you really don't need to learn about them before you start writing Objective-C programs.\nI will be curious to get feedback on whether my approach works.Posted by: Stephen Kochan on November 18, 2003 12:56 PM"

        "articleBody": "|Japan Table of Contents\n|\nJapan-United States relations were more uncertain in the early 1990s than at any time since World War II. As long-standing military allies and increasingly interdependent economic partners, Japan and the United States cooperated closely to build a strong, multifaceted relationship based on democratic values and interests in world stability and development. Japan-United States relations improved enormously in the 1970s and 1980s, as the two societies and economies became increasingly intertwined. In 1990 their combined gross national product (GNP) totaled about one third of the world's GNP. Japan received about 11 percent of United States exports (a larger share than any other country except Canada), and the United States bought about 34 percent of Japan's exports. Japan had US$148 billion in direct investment in the United States in 1991, while the United States had more than US$17 billion invested in Japan. Some US$100 billion in United States government securities held by institutions in Japan helped finance much of the United States budget deficit. Economic exchanges were reinforced by a variety of scientific, technical, tourist, and other exchanges. Each society continued to see the other as its main ally in Asia and the Pacific. Certain developments in the late 1980s damaged bilateral relations. Nevertheless, public opinion surveys continued to reveal that substantial majorities of Japanese and Americans believed that the bilateral relationship was vital to both countries.\nGrowing interdependence was accompanied by markedly changing circumstances at home and abroad that were widely seen to have created a crisis in Japan-United States relations in the late 1980s. United States government officials continued to emphasize the positive aspects of the relationship but warned that there was a need for \"a new conceptual framework.\" The Wall Street Journal publicized a series of lengthy reports documenting changes in the relationship in the late 1980s and reviewing the considerable debate in Japan and the United States over whether a closely cooperative relationship was possible or appropriate for the 1990s. An authoritative review of popular and media opinion, published in 1990 by the Washington-based Commission on US-Japan Relations for the Twenty-first Century, was concerned with preserving a close Japan-United States relationship. It warned of a \"new orthodoxy\" of \"suspicion, criticism and considerable self- justification,\" which it said was endangering the fabric of Japan- United States relations.\nThree sets of factors stand out as the most important in explaining the challenges facing Japan-United States relations. They are economic, political-military, and domestic in nature.\nThe relative economic power of Japan and the United States was undergoing sweeping change, especially in the 1980s. This change went well beyond the implications of the United States trade deficit with Japan, which had remained between US$40 billion and US$48 billion annually since the mid-1980s. The persisting United States trade and budget deficits of the early 1980s led to a series of decisions in the middle of the decade that brought a major realignment of the value of Japanese and United States currencies. The stronger Japanese currency gave Japan the ability to purchase more United States goods and to make important investments in the United States. By the late 1980s, Japan was the main international creditor.\nJapan's growing investment in the United States--it was the second largest investor after Britain--led to complaints from some American constituencies. Moreover, Japanese industry seemed well positioned to use its economic power to invest in the high- technology products in which United States manufacturers were still leaders. The United States's ability to compete under these circumstances was seen by many Japanese and Americans as hampered by heavy personal, government, and business debt and a low savings rate.\nIn the late 1980s, the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe and the growing preoccupation of Soviet leaders with massive internal political and economic difficulties forced the Japanese and United States governments to reassess their longstanding alliance against the Soviet threat. Officials of both nations had tended to characterize the security alliance as the linchpin of the relationship, which should have priority over economic and other disputes. Some Japanese and United States officials and commentators continued to emphasize the common dangers to Japan- United States interests posed by the continued strong Soviet military presence in Asia. They stressed that until Moscow followed its moderation in Europe with major demobilization and reductions in its forces positioned against the United States and Japan in the Pacific, Washington and Tokyo needed to remain militarily prepared and vigilant.\nIncreasingly, however, other perceived benefits of close Japan- United States security ties were emphasized. The alliance was seen as deterring other potentially disruptive forces in East Asia, notably the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Ironically, some United States officials noted that the alliance helped keep Japan's potential military power in check and under the supervision of the United States.\nThe post-Cold War environment strengthened the relative importance of economic prowess over military power as the major source of world influence in the early 1990s. This shift affected the perceived relative standing of Japan, the United States, and other powers. Increasingly, Japan was expected to shoulder international aid and economic responsibilities that in the past were discharged by the United States and other Western countries.\nThe declining Soviet threat, the rising power of the Japanese economy, increasingly close United States interaction (and related disputes) with Japan, and other factors led by 1990 to a decided shift in United States opinion about Japan and to less marked but nonetheless notable shifts in Japanese opinion. In the United States, this shift was reflected in questions about which was the more serious, the military threat from the Soviet Union or the economic challenge from Japan. In a series of polls in 1989 and 1990, most respondents considered the challenge from Japan the more serious. Similarly, poll data from early 1990 showed that most Japanese considered negative United States attitudes toward Japan a reflection of United States anger at \"America's slipping economic position.\" Meanwhile, Japanese opinion was showing greater confidence in Japan's ability to handle its own affairs without constant reference--as in the past--to the United States. Japan's belief in United States reliability as a world leader also lessened.\nIn both countries, new or \"revisionist\" views of the Japan- United States relationship were promoted. In Japan some commentators argued that the United States was weak, dependent on Japan, and unable to come to terms with world economic competition. They urged Japan to strike out on a more independent course. In the United States, prominent commentators warned of a Japanese economic juggernaut, out of control of the Japanese government, which needed to be \"contained\" by the United States.\nAt the same time, it was easy to overstate the changes in opinion in both countries. The Japanese still considered the United States positively as their closest friend, the principal guardian of their external security, their most important economic partner and market, and the exemplar of a life-style that had much to offer--and much to envy. Moreover, the vast majority of Americans still viewed Japan positively, had high respect for Japanese accomplishments, and supported the United States defense commitment to Japan.\nIn the years after World War II, Japan's relations with the United States were placed on an equal footing for the first time at the end of the occupation by the Allied forces in April 1952. This equality, the legal basis of which was laid down in the peace treaty signed by forty-eight Allied nations and Japan, was initially largely nominal, because in the early postoccupation period Japan required direct United States economic assistance. A favorable Japanese balance of payments with the United States was achieved in 1954, mainly as a result of United States military and aid spending in Japan.\nThe Japanese people's feeling of dependence lessened gradually as the disastrous results of World War II subsided into the background and trade with the United States expanded. Self-confidence grew as the country applied its resources and organizational skill to regaining economic health. This situation gave rise to a general desire for greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s and 1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese attitude toward United States military bases on the four main islands of Japan and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds of the Ryukyu Islands.\nThe government had to balance left-wing pressure advocating dissociation from the United States against the realities of the need for military protection. Recognizing the popular desire for the return of the Ryukyu Islands and the Bonin Islands (also known as the Ogasawara Islands), the United States as early as 1953 voluntarily relinquished its control of the Amami group of islands at the northern end of the Ryukyu Islands. But the United States made no commitment to return Okinawa, which was then under United States military administration for an indefinite period as provided in Article 3 of the peace treaty. Popular agitation culminated in a unanimous resolution adopted by the Diet in June 1956, calling for a return of Okinawa to Japan.\nBilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959, and the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was signed in Washington on January 19, 1960. When the pact was submitted to the Diet for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter debate over the Japan-United States relationship and the occasion for violence in an all-out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its passage. It was finally approved by the House of Representatives on May 20. Japan Socialist Party deputies boycotted the lower house session and tried to prevent the LDP deputies from entering the chamber; they were forcibly removed by the police. Massive demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions followed. These outbursts prevented a scheduled visit to Japan by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and precipitated the resignation of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, but not before the treaty was passed by default on June 19, when the House of Councillors failed to vote on the issue within the required thirty days after lower house approval.\nUnder the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to assist each other in case of armed attack on territories under Japanese administration. (It was understood, however, that Japan could not come to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally forbidden to send armed forces overseas. In particular, the constitution forbids the maintenance of \"land, sea, and air forces.\" It also expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of \"the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes\". Accordingly, the Japanese find it difficult to send their \"self-defense\" forces overseas, even for peace-keeping purposes.) The scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu Islands, but an appended minute made clear that in case of an armed attack on the islands, both governments would consult and take appropriate action. Notes accompanying the treaty provided for prior consultation between the two governments before any major change occurred in the deployment of United States troops or equipment in Japan. Unlike the 1952 security pact, the new treaty provided for a ten-year term, after which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by either party. The treaty included general provisions on the further development of international cooperation and on improved future economic cooperation.\nBoth countries worked closely to fulfill the United States promise, under Article 3 of the peace treaty, to return all Japanese territories acquired by the United States in war. In June 1968 the United States returned the Bonin Islands (including Iwo Jima) to Japanese administration control. In 1969 the Okinawa reversion issue and Japan's security ties with the United States became the focal points of partisan political campaigns. The situation calmed considerably when Prime Minister Sato Eisaku visited Washington in November 1969, and in a joint communiqu\u00e9 signed by him and President Richard M. Nixon, announced the United States agreement to return Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In June 1971, after eighteen months of negotiations, the two countries signed an agreement providing for the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.\nThe Japanese government's firm and voluntary endorsement of the security treaty and the settlement of the Okinawa reversion question meant that, two major political issues in Japan-United States relations were eliminated. But new issues arose. In July 1971, the Japanese government was surprised by Nixon's dramatic announcement of his forthcoming visit to the People's Republic of China. Many Japanese were chagrined by the failure of the United States to consult in advance with Japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign policy. The following month, the government was again surprised to learn that, without prior consultation, the United States had imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports, a decision certain to hinder Japan's exports to the United States. Relations between Tokyo and Washington were further strained by the monetary crisis involving the December 1971 revaluation of the Japanese yen.\nThese events of 1971 marked the beginning of a new stage in relations, a period of adjustment to a changing world situation that was not without episodes of strain in both political and economic spheres, although the basic relationship remained close. The political issues between the two countries were essentially security-related and derived from efforts by the United States to induce Japan to contribute more to its own defense and to regional security. The economic issues tended to stem from the ever-widening United States trade and payments deficits with Japan, which began in 1965 when Japan reversed its imbalance in trade with the United States and, for the first time, achieved an export surplus.\nThe United States withdrawal from Indochina in 1975 and the end of the Second Indochina War meant that the question of Japan's role in the security of East Asia and its contributions to its own defense became central topics in the dialogue between the two countries. United States dissatisfaction with Japanese defense efforts began to surface in 1975 when Secretary of Defense James A. Schlesinger publicly stigmatized Japan as a passive defense partner.\nUnited States pressures continued and intensified, particularly as events in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East after 1979 caused the United States to relocate more than 50 percent of its naval strength from East Asian waters to the Indian Ocean. Japan was repeatedly pressed not only to increase its defense expenditures and build up its antisubmarine and naval patrol capabilities but also to play a more active and positive security role generally.\nThe Japanese government, constrained by constitutional limitations and strongly pacifist public opinion, responded slowly to pressures for a more rapid buildup of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). It steadily increased its budgetary outlays for those forces, however, and indicated its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining the United States military bases in Japan. In 1976 the United States and Japan formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation, in the framework of a bilateral Security Consultative Committee provided for under the 1960 security treaty. This subcommittee, in turn, drew up new Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation, under which military planners of the two countries have conducted studies relating to joint military action in the event of an armed attack on Japan.\nOn the economic front, Japan sought to ease trade frictions by agreeing to Orderly Marketing Arrangements, which limited exports on products whose influx into the United States was creating political problems. In 1977 an Orderly Marketing Arrangement limiting Japanese color television exports to the United States was signed, following the pattern of an earlier disposition of the textile problem. Steel exports to the United States were also curtailed, but the problems continued as disputes flared over United States restrictions on Japanese development of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities, Japanese restrictions on certain agricultural imports, such as beef and oranges, and liberalization of capital investment and government procurement within Japan.\nTo respond to the call, from its allies and from within the country as well, for a greater and more responsible role in the world, Japan developed what Ohira Masayoshi, after he became prime minister in December 1978, called a \"comprehensive security and defense strategy to safeguard peace.\" Under this policy, Japan sought to place its relations with the United States on a new footing--one of close cooperation but on a more reciprocal and autonomous basis, and on a global scale.\nThis policy was put to the test in November 1979, when radical Iranians seized the United States embassy in Tehran, taking sixty hostages. Japan reacted by condemning the action as a violation of international law. At the same time, Japanese trading firms and oil companies reportedly purchased Iranian oil that had become available when the United States banned oil imported from Iran. This action brought sharp criticism from the United States of Japanese government \"insensitivity\" for allowing the oil purchases and led to a Japanese apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against Iran in concert with other United States allies.\nFollowing that incident, the Japanese government took greater care to support United States international policies designed to preserve stability and promote prosperity. Japan was prompt and effective in announcing and implementing sanctions against the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. In 1981, in response to United States requests, it accepted greater responsibility for defense of seas around Japan, pledged greater support for United States forces in Japan, and persisted with a steady buildup of the SDF.\nA qualitatively new stage of Japan-United States cooperation in world affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro. Officials of the Ronald Reagan administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their common security and international outlook. Nakasone reassured United States leaders of Japan's determination against the Soviet threat, closely coordinated policies with the United States toward such Asian trouble spots as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and worked cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The Japanese government welcomed the increase of United States forces in Japan and the western Pacific, continued the steady buildup of the SDF, and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States against the threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued to cooperate closely with United States policy in these areas following Nakasone's term of office, although the political leadership scandals in Japan in the late 1980s made it difficult for newly elected President George Bush to establish the same kind of close personal ties that marked the Reagan years.\nA specific example of Japan's close cooperation with the United States included its quick response to the United States call for greater host nation support from Japan following the rapid realignment of Japan-United States currencies in the mid-1980s. The currency realignment resulted in a rapid rise of United States costs in Japan, which the Japanese government, upon United States request, was willing to offset. Another set of examples was provided by Japan's willingness to respond to United States requests for foreign assistance to countries considered of strategic importance to the West. During the 1980s, United States officials voiced appreciation for Japan's \"strategic aid\" to countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, and Jamaica. Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki's pledges of support for East European and Middle Eastern countries in 1990 fit the pattern of Japan's willingness to share greater responsibility for world stability.\nDespite complaints from some Japanese businesses and diplomats, the Japanese government remained in basic agreement with United States policy toward China and Indochina. The government held back from large-scale aid efforts until conditions in China and Indochina were seen as more compatible with Japanese and United States interests. Of course, there also were instances of limited Japanese cooperation. Japan's response to the United States decision to help to protect tankers in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88) was subject to mixed reviews. Some United States officials stressed the positive, noting that Japan was unable to send military forces because of constitutional reasons but compensated by supporting the construction of a navigation system in the Persian Gulf, providing greater host nation support for United States forces in Japan, and providing loans to Oman and Jordan. Japan's refusal to join even in a mine-sweeping effort in the Persian Gulf was an indication to some United States officials of Tokyo's unwillingness to cooperate with the United States in areas of sensitivity to Japanese leaders at home or abroad.\nThe main area of noncooperation with the United States in the 1980s was Japanese resistance to repeated United States efforts to get Japan to open its market more to foreign goods and to change other economic practices seen as adverse to United States economic interests. A common pattern was followed. The Japanese government was sensitive to political pressures from important domestic constituencies that would be hurt by greater openness. In general, these constituencies were of two types--those representing inefficient or \"declining\" producers, manufacturers, and distributors, who could not compete if faced with full foreign competition; and those up-and-coming industries that the Japanese government wished to protect from foreign competition until they could compete effectively on world markets. To deal with domestic pressures while trying to avoid a break with the United States, the Japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations. This tactic bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new industries to grow stronger. Agreements reached dealt with some aspects of the problems, but it was common for trade or economic issues to be dragged out in talks over several years, involving more than one market-opening agreement. Such agreements were sometimes vague and subject to conflicting interpretations in Japan and the United States.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, United States administrations had favored an issue-by-issue approach in negotiating such economic disputes with Japan. This approach ostensibly limited the areas of dispute. But it resulted in widespread negative publicity, at a time when changing economic and security circumstances were causing both countries to reevaluate the relationship. Notable outpourings of United States congressional and media rhetoric critical of Japan accompanied the disclosure in 1987 that Toshiba had illegally sold sophisticated machinery of United States origin to the Soviet Union, which reportedly allowed Moscow to make submarines quiet enough to avoid United States detection, and the United States congressional debate in 1989 over the Japan-United States agreement to develop a new fighter aircraft--the FSX--for Japan's Air Self- Defense Force.\nA new approach was added in 1989. The so-called Structural Impediments Initiative was a series of talks designed to deal with domestic structural problems limiting trade on both sides. After several rounds of often contentious talks, agreements were reached in April and July 1990 that promised major changes in such sensitive areas as Japanese retailing practices, land use, and investment in public works. The United States pledged to deal more effectively with its budget deficit and to increase domestic savings. United States supporters saw the Structural Impediments Initiative talks as addressing fundamental causes of Japan-United States economic friction. Skeptics pointed to them as ways for officials to buy time and avoid an acute crisis in Japan-United States relations. The Bill Clinton administration decided to end the Structural Impediments Initiative in the summer of 1993 as a framework for dealing with United States-Japan bilateral relations.\nJapan Table of Contents\nSource: U.S. Library of Congress"

        "articleBody": "[Preliminary remarks: I\nsincerely apologise for the fact that due to the prevailing circumstances,\nand the conditions under which this text has been composed, I have been\nunable:\n- to avoid some repetitions in its various parts,\n- to display a fully consistent transliteration, some words or expressions appearing in the ITRANS 5.1 encoding scheme, while some others appear with the usual diacritics (but placed after the letter instead of above it, as impossible in a standard wordprocessor), and long vowels are shown with a circumflex (often used when gallicising or diplaying in French texts Sanskrit words in fonts with no macron available; (Hence what should be in strict ITRANS shrii may appear here as Sr\u00ee.) I do hope these stylistic and typographic defects will no make the reading too tedious.\nI have been kindly requested to write an article about my experience and interest in the IITM Software. Upon receiving this suggestion I must confess I met with two contradictory feelings. On the one hand, I was pleased and even also somewhat proud; I felt glad indeed if I could in any way bring a contribution to young Indian students, as being myself a Westerner with a very great moral and spiritual debt towards Mother India, at least and at last I could perhaps do something useful towards Her and her children.\nOn the other end, I felt\nsomewhat reluctant because writing such an article meant inevitably speaking\nat length about myself, which I do hate and find utterly repellent. Even\nin French we use to say: \u00ab le moi est ha\u00efssable \u00bb, i.e.\n\u00ab The I is detestable \u00bb. And I was deeply aware of that long\nbefore I read the famous words from the Bhagavatpaada:\nmanobuddhyaha.nkaarachittaani naahaM.\nBut after pondering carefully over the subject the first feeling overcame the second, and here follows my small article (at least I shall try to make it short in spite of an inborn tendency to be often quite talkative and prone to unending comments). I shall make it in three parts:\nI. My condition as a heavily disabled person\nII. My interest in the Sanaatana Dharma\nIII. My interest in the IITM software\nI. My condition as a heavily disabled person\nI was fortunate enough not to be born disabled nor did it happen during my childhood, which thanks to the Gods was very healthy and happy, apart from the fact that my father died when I was very young, only just more than 10 year old, which had very crucial and long lasting consequences for the rest of my life.\nNow aged 55, my handicap came totally unexpectedly a few days before my 49th birthday in the end of 1994, when all of a sudden as a result of overwork, strain and stress (I was the Managing Director of a medium-sized company and did not hesitate during several years in very difficult business circumstances to work for 14 and to 16 hour a day) I had a brain infarct, which resulted in a stroke of hemiplegia and I remained paralysed on the left side of my body. In one way, I was rather fortunate and blessed by the Gods that, first I did not die on the spot, or during the first three following days, which is often the case, and second that the accident took place in the right side of my brain, thus affecting the left side of my body; should had it been the reverse, I should have lost speech and my hand-writing capability, a full disaster for me who happen to be a right-handed person. After six months of highly dedicated rehabilitation in a physiotherapy clinic, with a lot of will, endurance and determination I could recover pretty well but not enough to be able to take up my old job again. I was dismissed by my company in 1995 and was declared an invalid by the French Social Security. Since then I am so to say a kind of person in early retirement.\nUnfortunately in 1995 and\n1997 I experienced some more health problems in my brain that more or less\nruined the good recovery I had reached before those complications. In any\ncase, I can walk just a little inside my home with the help of a walking\nstick and am not compelled to spend the whole day sitting on my wheelchair.\nThe biggest problem for me comes from my left hand that is now virtually\ndead. Prior to my accident I was very excellent indeed at typing on a keyboard,\nhaving learnt at school during my commercial studies, and using professionally\nand rapidly all my ten fingers from both hands. Now I can type with only\nthree fingers of my right hand.\nII. My interest in the Sanaatana Dharma\nBorn in France, (in a family\nnative of Alsace near the German border, why my name does not sound typically\nFrench, like Dupont or Durand), just after Worl War II, in late November\n1945, I had always been a very religious boy, but when I reached 14, I\ncould no longer remain satisfied with the creeds, beliefs and practices\nof the Roman Catholic Church, in which I had been being born and educated.\nThese did not appear to me \u00ab catholic \u00bb enough, as this word\nshould originally mean \u00ab universal \u00bb. One day, about November\n1960 (i.e. aged more or less exactly 15), while looking at random at books\nin a bookshop that I used to visit quite often (in Paris where I was born\nand living at that time), I started to turn over, just by a stroke of luck,\nthe pages of the French translation of \u00ab J\u00f1\u00e2na Yoga\n\u00bb of Sv\u00e2m\u00ee Vivek\u00e2nanda, and was seized with wonder\nseeing that the book included two chapters on a universal religion. I felt\nthis was exactly what I was longing for, and I bought the book immediately\nand read it eagerly from cover to cover: I was overwhelmed with joy and\nwanted to know more. After reading \u00ab J\u00f1\u00e2na Yoga\n\u00bb several times, I wanted to know also about S'r\u00ee R\u00e2makrishna.\nI started to look for further literature on the Paramahamsa, and in a rather\nsmall booklet learnt at last that there existed one R\u00e2makrishna Ved\u00e2nta\nCentre in France. I got the address from the Indian Embassy in Paris. All\nthese investigations had of course taken some time, and it was only in\nearly May 1961 (it was thus exactly 40 years on the 4th of May 2001), aged\n15 year and a half, that I first visited the French R\u00e2makrishna Ved\u00e2nta\nCentre in Gretz.There, I came fortunately very rapidly into a tight and\nfriendly relationship with a brahm\u00e2c\u00e2ri, disciple of the late\nSv\u00e2m\u00ee Siddhes'var\u00e2nanda, who had founded the Centre in\n1937 in Paris, and had then established it in Gretz in 1947. Unfortunately\nhe had passed away 4 years earlier, in beginning April 1957 and I could\nnot meet him personally. Sv\u00e2m\u00ee Siddhes'var\u00e2nanda was\nhimself a disciple of Sv\u00e2m\u00ee Brahm\u00e2nanda, a direct disciple\nof S'r\u00ee R\u00e2makrishna, appearing often in the so-called \u00ab\nGospel \u00bb (I do not like the use of this Christian name and prefer\nto stick to the original tittle \u00ab Kath\u00e2mrita \u00bb: Sv\u00e2m\u00ee\nBrahm\u00e2nanda was R\u00e2kh\u00e2l, in the inner circle of young\ndisciples, and later he became the President of the Math and Mission).\nI became fortunately very rapidly an enthusiastic student of the above-mentioned\nbrahm\u00e2c\u00e2ri.\nMy main subject of study with my Ved\u00e2nta teacher (apart from the teachings of Paramahamsa S'r\u00ee R\u00e2makrishna) was avasth\u00e2traya vic\u00e2ra as taught to Sv\u00e2m\u00ee Siddhes'var\u00e2nanda by his own teacher in philosophy S'r\u00ee V. Subrahmania Iyer, a prominent philosopher of the XXth century (reader in Philosophy of the Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja of Mysore) and himself (S'r\u00ee Iyer) a disciple of His Holiness S'r\u00ee Saccid\u00e2nanda S'iv\u00e2bhinava Narasimha Bharat\u00ee Mahasv\u00e2m\u00ee, Jagadguru of S'ringeri from 1878 to 1912.\nSv\u00e2m\u00ee Siddhes'var\u00e2nanda always insisted on the fact that exactly as one needs two legs for walking or two hands for working (I experience myself this point every day more painfully than anybody else), we need, in this age, for our spiritual life to harmonise the teachings of S'r\u00ee R\u00e2makrishna and the pure Ved\u00e2nta of S'ankara as taught by the above-mentioned Jagadguru of S'ringeri to S'r\u00ee Subrahmania Iyer, and mainly emphasizing avasth\u00e2traya vic\u00e2ra, the major and unique contribution of the Indian philosophy to the universal philosophy, most of the other aspects of the Indian philosophy or theology having already more or less their equivalent or counterpart in the Western thought. That is what I dedicated my life to.\nApart from a repeated study of the Bhagavad G\u00eet\u00e2 and of course all major Upanishads I had a special interest for the mANDUkyakArikA of GauDaPAda, which deals only with the avastha-s.\nAlso, I read again and again and studied very carefully, and even translated in parts \u00ab VED\u00c2NTA, OR THE SCIENCE OF REALITY \u00bb of S'r\u00ee K.A. Krishnasvami Iyer.\nHaving also studied all\nfour volumes of THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF INDIA, published by the RAMAKRISHNA\nINSTITUTE OF CULTURE, I translated into French the two articles from volume\nIII:\nTHE ESSENTIALS OF VEDANTA by S'r\u00ee V. Subrahmania Iyer and\nPHILOSOPHY OF ADVAITA by S'r\u00ee K.A. Krishnasvami Iyer\nI also translated into French\nMAN'S INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY by S'r\u00ee V. Subrahmania Iyer first published in 1936 by Messrs Allen and Unwin in \u00ab CONTEMPORARY INDIAN PHILOSOPHY \u00bb edited by S. Radhakrishnan and J.H. Muirhead in the Muirhead Library of Philosophy and also later included in \u00ab THE PHILOSOPHY OF TRUTH OR TATTVAGNANA \u00bb a collection of speeches and writings by Sri V. Subrahmania Iyer edited by Dr T.M.P. MAHADEVAN, Department of Philosophy, University of Madras, 1955, upon request of S'r\u00ee Iyer's family.\nBut none of these translations have been published so far. I shall hand them to my sons who shall make a good use of it, I feel sure. (more in \u00a7 III.)\nAs my father had passed away when I was only a little more than 10 year old, and that we were not rich people, I could not afford long academic studies (quite attracted by languages, I should have felt inclined to study Sanskrit at the University, along with Bengali, to be able to read the S'r\u00ee R\u00e2makrishna Kath\u00e2mrita in the original language, and possibly translate it into French), but instead I had to start earning my living just after finishing my military training.\nThus, slightly over 20 equipped only with basic occupational commercial studies acquired before my military training (from 15 to 19), I started a nearly 30-year long career with the Swedish Paper Industry, first as a local salesman, then as the Managing Director of 3 different Sales Companies. Instead of Sanskrit and Bengali, I learnt Swedish, which I talk and write just about as fluently as French.\nAlthough not properly a translator, I had to do a lot of translations from Swedish and English into French, and hence also devoted much of my vacant time to \u00ab translation studies \u00bb to become as proficient as ever possible on the subject, which also helped me to a large extent for my subsequent Vedantic translations.\nFrom 1970 to 1981, then still living in Paris, I delivered 104 lectures, mostly on Indian philosophy and other aspects of the San\u00e2tana Dharma. I am extremely afflicted not to have been blessed by the DIVINE MOTHER to reach the sacred number of 108, but with HER help and blessings I shall try again to make it in my next life!\nMy professional life was very successful but in 1994, there were a many problems in my Mother Company in Sweden, because of mergers. I was chosen as the Manager for the new French Sales Company resulting from the merger, but this meant a lot of overwork and additional strain, which resulted in the stroke of hemiplegia mentioned in the \u00a7 I, which left me paralysed on my left side (in the beginning of November 1994, 3 weeks exactly before my 49th birthday). In my medical ignorance, I felt pretty sure that problems with brain arteries were always more or less related to cholesterol and arteriosclerosis, and as I had never had any of these, and although a businessman had tried to have a very hygienic way of life, I felt myself somewhat well protected or immune against such problems and I did not hesitate to work more than I should have done. I really had even become what is termed in the U.S., I have heard, a \u00ab workaholic \u00bb. It was only in the hospital that the doctors explained to me that overwork, overtax and stress may as well provoke a \u00ab brain infarct \u00bb as the most commonly known \u00ab heart infarct \u00bb, all the more as in my case, the \u00ab infarct \u00bb was not a thrombosis (but I do not want to indulge into too many medical details, out of the subject, and for which I do not know all the necessary technical vocabulary in English). Besides, I may have been suffering, without knowing it, of a kind of hereditary weakness of the brain arteries' walls.\nAs already said, prior to my stroke, I had quite an excellent typing, very rapid too and highly qualified. But it's now all gone, my left hand being almost dead, and I type with only one or two fingers of my right hand. This is why my e-mail postings take (or at least used to take?) such a long time and are (were?) often full of typing errors.\nNormally, I try to read and read again chasing for these typos prior to sending e-mails. But first, there are always some typos that escape and second, it always gives me the occasion for a further digression, as new ideas are coming while reading and my messages, letters or texts use to become longer and longer with every attempt to get rid of typing errors.\nBut in March 2001 I bought a new computer and at the same time I invested in a speech recognition software, which works in French as well as in English and with the help of which I can now dictate my correspondence in both languages, as well as do my captivating translation work. The system runs very well and it is indeed one of the very good achievements of the information technology. And as a consequence, I do hope that a part of the above problems with typos will be eradicated in the future.\nMoreover, instead of typing I can now dictate my translations or the articles I intend to write, which is quite comfortable. Now if the voice recognition software normally does not make typos, it only recognises the sounds that reach the microphone and not the words nor their meaning; the machine does not understand you but only transfers on the screen the sounds it has received, including noises from the environment, which sometimes results in other types of errors very often quite unexpected and sometimes jocular. But this is quite another story. Anyway this digression leads me smoothly to the third part of my article.\nIII. My interest in the IITM software :\nAs soon as it became obvious to me that my professional life was over and that in this respect I had become socially an invalid or an early retired person, I decided to devote all my time and efforts to the topics that had been in the centre of all my life (even if at times in the background because of my job) Sanskrit and Ved\u00e2nta.\nIf I had started to learn some Sanskrit already when I was 15, as a fact I never went farther than some rudiments or basics and always remained a kind of eternal beginner. To be frank I had strictly no interest in learning such enlightening phrases like \"R\u00e2ma sees the two elephants\". What I wanted was to be able to translate very accurately the few verses from the Bhagavad G\u00eet\u00e2 or the texts from S'r\u00ee S'ankar\u00e2carya that I was quoting and commenting in my own lectures.\nThus I decided to start afresh my studies of the Sanskrit language in a very serious way this time; and with the development of the information technology and the Internet, there now exists very fascinating and facilitative possibilities that did not exist when I was only 15.\nMoreover I have not the pretence, ambition nor conceitedness to write my Complete Works. But when preparing the already mentioned 104 lectures that I delivered in Paris, I have accumulated such a huge documentation that I have a lot of material available for writing articles on several aspects of the San\u00e2tana Dharma and quite especially on Ved\u00e2nta and my favourite subject viz avasth\u00e2traya vic\u00e2ra.\nMarried in 1974, my wife and I have two sons now aged 25 and 23 who are studying and preparing themselves for the highest posts in the University. The eldest one is studying History and the youngest one Philosophy. When they have finished their studies, if my health is still permitting, and with the blessings of the DIVINE MOTHER, we intend to write all three of us a book on \"some aspects of Ved\u00e2nta in the XXth-century\". In the meantime as they have of course quite a lot of other subjects to prioritise, I have started writing some articles based on the archives I have available here. And this is where the IITM software is proving extremely useful to me. Although I try not to overdo it with them, those articles (or a few other translations I am continuing to do on the subject and some of which might have their place in the main dissertation) often include quotations or footnotes with Sanskrit words or sloka-s. It is obvious that most Westerners cannot the Sanskrit language, but I prefer in any case to supply the Sanskrit text for some translated sloka-s so that the readers can at least recognise the words. This being the case, it is of utmost importance to cite the aforesaid quotations in diacriticised Roman transliteration. But I have decided as a personal discipline as a well as an introduction to the Sanskrit language for my sons to show the text also in devan\u00e2gar\u00ee. And in this respect the IITM software is really unparalleled. Of course in the beginning things were not very easy for me, all the more as -as far as computers are concerned- I am only an average user and not at all a specialist of the information technology. But Dr R. Kalyanakrishnan spared no effort to help me and to facilitate things for me (even at the expense of explaining very basic details that I should have known, or reminding me some other ones I had known (when starting the computerisation of my firm) but had later forgotten), and I really feel very indebted and grateful to him for all what he has done in this respect.\nI came into contact with Dr Kalyanakrishnan upon suggestion of S'r\u00ee N. Krishnaswamy of Vidya Vrikshah whom I had got in touch with as to a translation of the maaNDuukyakarikaa, which is as the reader will have understood of the highest importance for me.\nThus the parts of the IITM\nsoftware that are of special and main interest to me are the ones that\nrefer to Sanskrit and I.P.A. transliteration. The transliteration into\nother Indian languages is less primary to me although useful at times for\nother purposes. As a fact I have some Hindu friends in what was until recently\nWest Bengal, in Kerala and also in Karnataka, and when writing to them\nby now I always try to write their first names in their own languages,\nBangla, Kannada or Malay\u00e2lam. This is only a small sign of friendship:\nthey know I cannot their language and do not intend to learn it either.\nBut I shall never speak Sanskrit with anybody either at least in this life!\nMy purpose is not to be able to buy milk in Sanskrit (as the CD-ROMs released\nlast year by Samskrita Bh\u00e2rati would like me to be able to do). My\nvery limited and egoistic aim is nothing but to try to read, understand\ncorrectly and if possible translate accurately into French just a few jewels\nof the Scriptures, of S'r\u00ee S'a.nkara's bh\u00e2shya-s and of the\nK\u00e2rik\u00e2-s. Should I succeed in doing that, it should actually\nbe quite enough for this life.\u00b7\nmailto:guy.werlings@wanadoo.fr"

The average consumer will spend around $700 this year on gifts; by making only the minimum payment on that $700 at an interest rate of 18% you could take up to 118 months (that's nearly 10 years) to pay off the debt and pay an estimated $665 in interest.\nIf you are unable to pay your balance in full, you can avoid holiday hangover and get your holiday bills paid off sooner by calling your credit card company and asking them to lower your credit card interest rate.\nWednesday December 20, 2006 | permalink | comments (0)\nGift Cards May Not Be The Perfect Gift\nGift cards can be a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for, or for whom shipping gifts is expensive or impractical. Unfortunately, gift cards aren't always the perfect gift as many come with fees and restrictions that make the gift a headache for the recipient.\nIf you're shopping for a gift card this holiday season, make sure you're aware of any expiration dates, restrictions and fees that apply to the card you're planning to purchase.\nMonday December 18, 2006 | permalink | comments (0)\nDo You Have a Serious Debt Problem?\nIf you think you have a serious debt problem, you probably do.

        "articleBody": "Summary: How your church can have a volunteer team of cyber-missionaries that can minister cross-culturally to unreached peoples at a total cost of between $1000 to $5000 a year and see between 100 and 1100 decisions for Christ in that people group.\nCybermissions - is the front-line use of the Internet for cross-cultural evangelism, discipleship, church-planting and training.\nWorldwide Internet Population:\n445.9 million (eMarketer)\n533 million (Computer Industry Almanac)\nProjection for 2004:\n709.1 million (eMarketer)\n945 million (Computer Industry Almanac)\nOnline Language Populations (September 2002)\nEnglish 36.5%; Chinese 10.9%, Japanese 9.7%,\nSpanish 7.2%, German 6.7%, Korean 4.5%,\nItalian 3.8%, French 3.5%, Portuguese 3.0%, Russian 2.9%, Dutch 2.0% (Source: Global Reach)\nFrom the above statistics it is clear that the Internet is no longer predominantly an English speaking medium and that Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean now occupy a significant portion of cyber-space along with major European languages such as Spanish., Portuguese and French.\nThere are over 275 million Internet searches each day and 80% of all Internet sessions begin at a search engine (Internetstatistics.com). Religion is one of the main topics people search for. Pew Internet surveys found that 28 million Americans get religion information online, that three million do so daily, and that 25 % of net users search for religion-related topics. Barna Research estimates that up to 50 million Americans may worship solely over the Internet by 2010. There is every indication that the Internet is a major source of religious information where people of many cultures and languages collect their spiritual facts and opinions in private. Thus its a place where missionaries must be.\nLocal churches can create a Cybermissions Project Team (CPT) that uses the church website, chat rooms and email to reach a specific ethnic group for Christ. A well-run cybermissions website can see three people a day or about 1100 people a year make commitments to Jesus as Lord and Savior.\nThis is because the website is a perpetual evangelist that works away 24/7 witnessing to seekers about Christ. The Internet is seeker-driven. People using the Internet are seeking information via search engines and links on other sites. When people arrive at your website its not an accident. They have typed a query into a search engine and arrived there. People not interested in God simply dont arrive at your church website they end up somewhere else, reading the weather or the news. So virtually 100% of the people you minister to will already have some level of interest. This makes evangelism so much easier! You can witness, via the Internet 24/7 to people who are already interested in finding out about God!\n2. Read the articles on cybermissions at http://www.aibi.ph/missions/ for some ideas to get you started.\n3. Get some web space. You need a domain name yourchurch.com and some space on a server. We use ChristianWebHost.com and have found them to be both affordable and reliable.\n4. Pray about what people group you should be ministering to. For a list of the 43 nations most suitable for a cybermissions strategy click here. Then go to our mission links site and do some research on your chosen nation at any of the mission portal sites listed there e.g strategicnetwork.org.\n6. Spend at least four hours a week working on the website and improving it.\n7. Reply to the emails that come in promptly and start ministering to people in your target group.\n8. Become a member of Cybermissions.Org and hang out with other people doing the same thing - its free. (Cybermissions.Org will open officially on 12th August 2003 as a web portal for cybermissionaries.)\nYou will probably pay around $19.95 a year for the domain name.\nThen around $10 a month for reliable ad-free hosting and $29.95 a month for broadband access at your home or church office. ($480 per annum)\nThen work on replacing a computer every two years so - $1000 p.a.\nThen maybe you want some expensive software - $1500 a year\nAnd you do some online advertising at $150 a month - $1800\nTotal costs = $4800 per annum. Or around $5000 per annum for a well-equipped active evangelistic outreach that may well bring between 100 to 1100 people to Christ.\nYou can start for $1000 per annum, $500 for the basics, (website, domain name, broadband) and $500 for extras. For good free open-source software go to http://www.sourceforge.net\nContact John Edmiston at johned@aibi.ph Ive been doing this since 1991, and Id love to help.\nCybermissions.Org\nAIBI\nMissions Page"

        "articleBody": "\u00ab Guardian Googlers Incompetent, Independent Inaccurate - But BBC Exec Excels | Main | Het spijt me, maar ... \u00bb\nI am aware that I sound pedantic at times, and I do apologise for that (while I'm at it, I'll also apologise for my use of British spelling, which I've adopted mainly to annoy two specific readers, who know who they are). In my defence, I can only point to a constitutional inablility to resist commenting on the mistakes, inaccuracy and poor writing that I see almost daily in the press.\nTake the work of Rowan Pelling, for example. She's apparently quite well known over here, though I had never heard of her until I recently started reading the Independent (because I'm lazy, and there's so much easy grist in its pages).\nSince I've first become aware of her - through noting with amusement her ignorant misuse of the word \"gainsay\" - I've learned that she is in fact past editor of something called the Erotic Review, which purports to bring erotic writing to the intelligentsia. More recently, she's been pressed into service as a judge of the prestigious Booker Prize for literature, as she repeatedly reminded us this summer.\nIncidentally, the first of those last three links is almost worth the \u00c2\u00a31 it costs to access. In it, Pelling complains of suffering from \"judges' tristesse\" - a depression, tinged with guilt, that afflicts literary prize givers after they make an award. In Rowan's case, the tristesse was particularly bad, since she was the very, very most important judge of all - the \"Florida\" of judges, as she put it (referring to that state's role in the 2000 US elections).\nI admit to wondering what she was going to write about once the Booker had been awarded, given the frequency with which she addressed that topic (and, more importantly, her role as judge). In fact, I was afraid that the tristesse would weigh so heavily upon her that she'd be forced to give up writing entirely.\nThankfully I needn't have worried - she reappears in the pages of yesterday's Evening Standard, having secured a job reviewing Love for Sale: A Global History of Prostitution. The post-Booker Pelling has lost none of her punch, and she mercilessly hits the reader with one shot after another.\nWasting no time, she lets us have it right from the opening bell, with a couple of glancing jabs:\n\"Legend has it that the Innuits have several hundred words for snow.\"\nSince she at least says \"legend has it,\" the opening combination isn't terribly painful - though including as it does the jarring variant spelling \"Innuits,\" it does impart a bit of a sting.\nBut the opening jabs soften us up for this:\n\"In the Hindu kingdoms of India in the last centuries BC, there were more than 300 different Sanskrit words for prostitute. I suppose that amply illustrates the cultural differences between people of hot and cold climes.\"\nOf course, it illustrates exactly nothing at all, not least because the first half of the comparison is so completely spurious. Nils Ringal, author of the book being reviewed, will no doubt be irritated that his factual nugget is sullied by the juxtaposition with one that's been so frequently debunked.\nSecond paragraph. The hapless reader is hit with:\n\"Ringal's comprehensive study of turning tricks is equally compelling in its broader picture, whisking the reader from the temple prostitutes of Mesopotamia to the New York Mayfair Madam ...\"\nWho is this 'Mayfair Madam', one wonders? Ms. Pelling, like her headline writer, seems to think that we'll all get the reference, but I've never heard of her. Either I don't know enough about prostitutes, or Rowan is inaccurately referring to the Mayflower Madam, who was all over the New York papers in the mid-80s.\nAlthough it's distressing to imagine the former Erotic Review editor making such an error, it is again no knockout punch in and of itself - but we're feeling just a tad woozy so early into the column.\nThird paragraph:\n\"He points out that Polynesian women, for example, have almost no concept of selling their favours when they can bestow them freely where they please and without censor.\"\nCensor/censure! Ouch - that one hurts! It might draw only a wince if seen in a freshman essay, but from the \"Florida of the Booker Prize\" it draws blood - the reader, still reeling from the jabs just thrown, staggers.\nStaggers, but carries gamely on - to the next paragraph:\n\"Prostitutes enjoyed some form of legislative protection and paid taxes in civilisations ranging from Chandragupta's Indian empire of 4BC ...\"\nOr maybe it was the 4th century BC. But what difference does it make? The fight is lost - after four such shots in four paragraphs, the reader is well and truly on the ropes, with no choice but to assume a defensive posture - dreading the next error (logical, linguistic or factual), and doubting every single assertion that Ms. Pelling makes.\nNovember 23, 2004 | Permalink\nMy favorite quote from Ms. Biddle Barrows:\n\"Never say anything on the phone that you wouldn't want your mother to hear at your trial.\"\nBTW, Ms. Pelling should check out this info on the folks of Polynesia...she might find it - um - interesting...\nWhat is it about Mangaia?\nPosted by: arlye at Nov 23, 2004 2:33:34 PM\nThe Mayflower Madam has relatives here in Princeton. The Convent Station Madam lived in Morris Township and used to be a real estate agent before the property values went down.\nNever heard of the Mayfair Madam but maybe E. F. Benson might have included her in The freaks of Mayfair\nPosted by: Fausta at Nov 23, 2004 3:36:20 PM\nMs. Pelling's \"The Decadent Handbook\" informs the decadence challenged among us \"how to run a brothel, arouse your pets and rollerblade decadently\". You may not see the connection immediately, but when you start charging by dog hours you'll be roller blading decadently all the way to the bank.\nPosted by: Frank at Nov 23, 2004 4:00:06 PM\nFausta, completely OT, is the Alchemist and Barrister still on Witherspoon Street?\nPosted by: arlye at Nov 23, 2004 4:13:49 PM\nHmm. I wonder if she has included any of my postings in her research?\nPosted by: Tim Newman at Nov 24, 2004 4:33:46 AM\nArlye, yes, the A&B's still on Witherspoon, and continues to do great business.\nAnother good spot in town is Triumph Brewery, but I don't know if you've been there. They're serving pumpkin ale for Thanksgiving.\nPosted by: Fausta at Nov 24, 2004 8:10:10 PM\nYour killing me Scott!\nFunny stuff man.\nPosted by: Arvin at Nov 27, 2004 10:31:07 AM"

There's a constant need to keep current on emerging technologies, pressure from your customers to deliver products ahead-of-schedule, and a desire to build robust and scalable architectures.\nDespite understanding the importance of performance to the success of any application, and the attempting to design and architect your application to ensure that it's robust and scalable, performance management is probably more of an after-thought and doesn't become a critical issue until production when the customer experiences a problem.\nIf you had a very simple application, it might not be too difficult to diagnose the problem. But, you're probably using Web services, JMS, Servlets, EJBs, and other distributed technologies. When you're given a support request such as, \"the application is slow\", you're most likely spending countless hours trying to identify and diagnose the performance problem. You won't have enough information to know where to even start, which will make it very difficult to recreate the problem outside of production.\nThis leads us to the developer's dilemma. If you want to spend more type playing with new technologies such as grid computing or AOP, or you want to build more functionality, you have to balance that with the requirements to support the application.\nConsider the \"traditional\" approach commonly used to deal with performance issues. We are all familiar with the tried-and-true \"printf\" approach for measuring method call times. This technique can be quite useful, except when you have to correlate individual method times with an end-user experience. Spreadsheets and calculators can be your friend here, but it can be very time consuming.\nYou might also be able to leverage a variety of operating system tools to help diagnose the problem. If the production machine is hitting 100% CPU utilization, you might leverage a tool such as glance to analyze the problem. Or, if you're experiencing thread contention or Java memory issues, you might leverage specific JVM tools to identify the bottleneck. Often, these techniques are too bottoms-up, making it difficult, if not impossible, to understand how any single component might impact the end user's experience.\nIf you're lucky, you may have had the opportunity to work with some simple management tools. Maybe you're leveraging the WebLogic administration console to get some application server statistics. Or, you might have even toyed with ARM, JMX, or Log4J. Even in these situations, the tools at your disposal often only provide part of the answer, and you are left to piece the puzzle together to resolve the problem.\nBottom line, many of the current approaches used to diagnose performance problems are often very time-intensive, requiring hours or days to diagnose. Many times, the problem isn't even related to the application. It could be a network issue or a database issue, but you've just wasted three days supporting the application instead of enhancing it.\nOVTA from HP helps you isolate application performance problems in your J2EE applications. Rather than spending the time adding those printf statements, stepping through your code, and trying to identify exactly where your performance bottleneck is occurring, you can now use a tool that can provide you with all kinds of information about your application's performance.\nOVTA captures end-to-end transaction information and tells you if your transactions are flowing smoothly across the different application tiers, including the client, the web server, the app server and the database tiers. It will show you right down to the J2EE component, the location of the performance bottlenecks in a given transaction.\nNow, we can all make mistakes in our code, especially if we're on a time crunch or are simply on a roll and hammering out code deep into the night. Once we have our code developed, how do we determine whether it contains a memory leak or a thread contention problem? Better still, how do we track the leak back to the source code and fix the issue? With the OVTA Java Diagnostics (JD) tool, we can quickly determine if our application is experiencing any memory leaks, and where any source code level performance bottlenecks are located.\nNow you can do all of this in matter of minutes. Instead of spending a half-day stepping through various aspects of your code, trying to piece together the performance puzzle and making guesses on where the performance bottleneck might be, you can use OVTA to quickly diagnose the performance problems in your application.\nLet's take a look at how we can isolate an application performance problem in our application using OVTA.\nIn this particular scenario, an IT operator or the application owner is monitoring the application for availability and response time. They might be using a product such as HP OpenView Internet Service (OVIS) to monitor the application from end-to-end to determine overall availability and performance. Here, we see a screenshot of this product indicating that the response time of our application is not in an acceptable state. As the operator or support specialist does some quick root cause analysis, he finds that it is your application that isn't performing up to defined service levels. He contacts you immediately and asks you to look at a problem that is occurring with your application. He doesn't tell you much except that your application transaction response time rate is twice the accepted rate. So how are you going to solve this problem? Let's now take a look at this problem through the perspective of OVTA.\nKey OVTA differentiators\nExtended application and platform support\nIn the demonstration, transaction data was correlated across all of the application tiers. This is particularly important when you are trying to assess the exact component causing the bottleneck, including network or database issues that are beyond your control. This can cut the diagnostic time down to just minutes so that you can quickly address the problem.\nHP also offers OVTA Java Diagnostics, a profiling tool that allows you to perform application level analysis on running J2EE applications. The tool enables operations staff and developers to work together effectively in diagnosing performance bottlenecks, helping to diagnose memory leaks, source code performance problems, and other JVM issues.\nAdditionally, the impact of having OVTA monitoring and tracking the performance of your application is very low. At a high level, the product provides sufficient data to monitor the application with negligible overhead. You can also tune the amount of trace information captured when performing diagnostics. And even then, the overhead can be controlled to stay at very acceptable ranges while the problem is assessed.\nOVTA offers broad platform and application support, supporting HP-UX, Solaris, Windows, and Linux, and is capable of supporting both J2EE and .NET platforms. The product is optimized to support the WebLogic platform. Additionally, the product leverages JMX technology to monitor and assess the overall health of the WebLogic server. Metrics such as JVM memory utilization can be used to correlate the health of the server with the performance of your application.\nWhy is designing for manageability important?\nWhat can you rely on for manageability?\nWhat role can you play in manageability?\nWe have just looked at a way to diagnose J2EE application performance problems using OVTA. One way to deal with these issues is to have the right sets of tools on hand to diagnose problems when they occur.\nBut, what if you could design your application in such a way that it contains sufficient information to be better managed in operations? Today, operations relies on the developer because the information available to them is not sufficient to handle the problem themselves. If you can make your applications more \"management aware\", you can hopefully minimize the demands IT support places on you.\nAdditionally, designing applications with \"management in mind\" has some clear benefits to your organization. With the right set of management interfaces exposed by an application, and operator can ensure a higher degree of application availability. Manageable application can also be made more flexible and adaptive in production.\nWhat can you do to make applications more manageable? The good news is that many application platforms today provide some amount management out-of-the-box. Almost all J2EE platforms, including WebLogic, expose management interfaces for the platform in the form of JMX MBeans. These interfaces can then leveraged by management systems such as HP OpenView.\nIn some cases, platform-level management is not sufficient to effectively manage an application in production. Some amount of work might be required by the developer up-front to expose application-level management interfaces.\nHP OpenView is a BEA preferred priority choice management partnerHP OpenView Internet Services\nYour application may be developed in isolation, but it probably won't run in isolation. There are dependencies on the application server, the database, and other IT infrastructure components. This larger \"management ecosystem\" requires the right level of manageability at all layers, and you play an important role here.\nThe HP OpenView Application Management Solution allows an application owner to comprehensively monitor their business-critical application environment. OVTA provides the insight into the application itself by drilling down to the component or method level, enabling you to quickly find the source of performance bottlenecks. OpenView Internet Services provides a view of the customer experience by monitoring the end-to-end performance and availability of your applications. Additionally, HP offers a set of Rapid Implementation Services which can help you rapidly install and configure OVIS and OVTA in as little as 5 days. HP OpenView Operations provides the ability to map and proactively monitor the underlying infrastructure that supports applications deployed on WebLogic Server or WebLogic Integration.\nObviously, HP can't do this alone. BEA and HP have teamed up to provide you with management solutions that ensure a high degree of stability, efficiency, and agility for the WebLogic platform. HP OpenView is already supporting WLS, WLI, and WLP to varying degrees. As a BEA preferred and priority management partner, HP is committed to further enhancing these management solutions with more robust and unique management capabilities moving forward.\nThere are some important next steps you can take to learn more about HP's application management solutions. You can download an evaluation copy of OVTA at the HP Management Software URL listed on this page. It is very easy to install and configure to run against your own applications.\nFor those of you that are considering application manageability through JMX, you are highly encouraged to visit our HP Developer Resource Central site. This site provides you with a variety of white papers, code samples, and developer tutorials on JMX. One of the tutorials shows how a BEA WebLogic sample application can be instrumented using JMX.

It's especially true for sci-fi TV shows, which love to bludgeon viewers with Major Themes: Being Human (Spock, Data, The Doctor, various clones); Cultural Diversity (aliens, we love you); What Is Real? (time travel; holodecks; shape shifters); Privacy and Individual Rights (telepaths); Religion (The Force); and of course, The Meaning of Life (Yoda).\nBut Babylon 5 wielded the biggest, bluntest instrument of all, and it smashed through season four to create an outsized beast of grandiosity. Everything about this set screams of self-conscious ambition.\nThe Show\nUltimately, Babylon 5 was all about the ideas of its creator and executive producer J. Michael Straczynski, who wrote the screenplays for the majority of the shows, including every episode of the last two seasons. His ambition dominated Babylon 5 throughout its run: \"I'm pretty rigorous in my scripts most of the time. I don't tend to allow for a lot of improvisation or a lot of changing around.\"\nThe content certainly drips with self-importance -- operatic music; exaggerated, acting; didactic dialogues about Really Important Topics; sweeping shots of battle -- and in its desperate attempt to be taken seriously, Babylon 5 ends up stagey and affected.\nWhy show consequences when his characters can tell us (and tell us and tell us and tell us) about them? Who needs naturalistic dialogue when there's preaching to be done? What's the use of small gestures when gesticulation can chew up the camera? Why cap the big showdown between Shadows and Vorlons with an exciting fight when you can end with a long-winded Sheridan speech?\nViewers might have thought the Shadow conflict - which powered the show for much of Babylon 5's first three years -- would take an entire season to complete, but it was resolved by the sixth show, Into the Fire, making the next 16 episodes feel a bit like one long denouement.\n|Rating||Description|\n|out of 10||click here for ratings guide|\n|9||The Movie\n|\nWe love it, we love it not.

        "articleBody": "H7 in North Korea\nIf the infection is with H7 subtype this would seem to be good news as human cases with H7 have not been particularly severe. H7N2 has been reported in poultry in the US (Delaware) and H7N7 caused a large outbreak in poultry in 2003 in The Netherlands which jumped to humans. Most cases manifested as conjunctivitis (\"pink eye\") and a small number (3) showed typical influenza-like symptoms (cough, fever, muscle aches). The only serious case involved a veterinarian who visited one of the farms and developed fatal respiratory distress syndrome.\nRelatively mild disease, yes. But the fly in the ointment is that this avian virus also showed itself to be quite transmissible to and among people. Eighty-three cases were reported initially among poultry workers with three possible subsequent transmissions to family members. A follow-up blood study with 500 farmers, their families and workers involved in the massive cull initially showed no antibodies to H7, even in those with confirmed infection. It turned out the hemagglutination assay (to see if a subject's blood serum made red blood cells clump together, a standard test for prior infection) worked with horse red blood cells, not the standard turkey rbcs. Even using horse rbcs, only about 50% of the previously infected patients showed agglutination, still not very sensitive. Using the modified assay, Dutch investigators estimated that at least 1000 and perhaps as many as 2000 people may have been infected. More importantly, close family contacts of poultry workers had a 59% seroprevalence of H7 antibodies, suggesting person to person transmission on large scale. Some other pertinent technical results:\n. . . having measurable antibodies was associated with having conjunctivitis (RR 1.72; 95% CI 0.99-2.99), and a lower proportion of the exposed persons who took prophylactic antiviral medication developed antibodies (corrected OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.89).Meanwhile, the North Koreans are declaring the outbreak over (Right. Maybe they want to sell me a bridge over the Yalu?). Even if true, questions remain, as New Scientist notes:\nNeither poultry farmers nor those engaged in controlling the epidemic complied satisfactorily with preventive measures. Only 6% of farmers reported consistent use of facial masks and 1% reported consistent use of goggles while working with infected poultry. In cullers, compliance was only slightly better: 25% consistently used facial masks and 13% used goggles. The results of the epidemiological study suggest that oseltamivir protected against conjunctivitis (corrected OR=0.14; 95% CI=0.08C0.27) as well as against infection without specific symptoms. No protective effect was demonstrable for safety goggles or mouth-nose masks.\nBut this is a mystery, as an outbreak of H7 has never been recorded in east Asia before. \u00e2The North Koreans say they have destroyed all the sick chickens, and the outbreak is now over,\u00e2 says [the FAO scientist]. \u00e2That\u00e2s good for the Koreans. But we\u00e2d like a sample of tissue from the infected birds so we can isolate the virus.\u00e2So the evidence has been destroyed? I'll bet it's still there. The problem will be getting it before it migrates elsewhere.\nA genetic sequence might help trace the strain\u00e2s origins, and whether it has mixed with other Asian strains."

This process, assures Dr. Martineau, will yield an interesting result.\nBefore sharing my insight, I'd like to make a comment about Carr's stories. As I had already read past \"Tanoo\" for today's class, I would need to re-read it once again. To peak my curiosity and hopefully uncover some life facts about Carr, I read Ira Dilworth's foreword. Dilworth writes about Carr's \"peeling\" of sentences to strip \"all ambiguous and unnecessary worlds, replacing a vague word by a sharper, clearer one until the sentence emerged clean and precise in its meaning and strong in its impact on the reader.\" With this armed knowledge, I found myself reading radically slower than usual, sometimes rereading a sentence two, three, something even four times trying to absorb, and reabsorb any uncaptured meanings like words of gold. By reading this way, I caught passages I had previously missed. In fact, it altered my first perception of the story. And after reading the 1941 edition, my perception of the Irwin edition once again altered, even more dramatically, this time.\nThe mentioning of the missionary's daughter accompanying Carr on her excursion to Tanoo with Jimmie and Louisa, I thought, was Carr's way of retelling in detail, every aspect of the trip. In fact, I found both \"Ucluelet,\" the first story in the book, set in a tone where missionaries were sympathetic and cordial with aboriginal peoples, such as their interaction with the Chief (In \"Sophie\") and with Mrs. Wynook. The notorious treatment of aboriginal families by European missionaries is well-known. Missionaries, recalls Carr, laughed at the tradition of totem poles, calling them heathenish. The missionary's daughter, whom upholds a \"superior\" European culture, found Jimmie and Louisa's habits savage-like, as shown in her refusal to try devilfish and exclaiming Tanoo, a place of spiritual value, as a \"Horrid place!\"\nI wonder why the later edition of \"Tanoo\" deletes certain passages, notably those in which Europeans are sneering at the aboriginal way of life. We know Carr is unbiased; she commit herself to understanding Native culture. She does not directly judge the missionary's daughter, introducing her as the missionary's \"pretty daughter.\" During the story, Carr only goes as far as calling her \"Miss Missionary,\" perhaps a sarcastic way of direct us to the pushiness of the girl. My belief is that Carr's European audience met her work(s) with harsh criticism. As a result, for profitability's sake, it is necessary to blot out racial statements for Europeans' who look to Carr's books to acquire knowledge about First Nations people.Home\n|\u00a9 2002|"

When do you think you will finish your dissertation?\nYour odds of landing a job are higher if you can convincingly argue you will be done by June (best) or at least by September. Employers do not like new assistant professors to arrive with unfinished dissertations (although many such assistant professors exist).\n3. What are you thinking about working on next?\nDescribe one or two research projects that you would like to work on next. You don't need to carry out these exact projects. You can include extensions of your thesis: ideas it has spawned, or tests of it you will someday do. At least one idea should be distinct from your thesis. On the other hand, don't be scattered. Most of your ideas should hang together, as if you were writing a book or two.\n4. What courses would you like to teach?\nBe sure to know the needs of the department before answering this one. Mention undergrad and grad courses, and perhaps an advanced grad course. The advanced courses are sought after; don't sound as if you demand to teach one. Mention a service course (intro, micro, or macro) that you are willing to teach.\nKnow the text you might use in the course, particularly for undergraduates. (You can ask around for plausible texts, and perhaps reading lists.) Think about an outline of topics for one or two courses.\nThe interviews are also for you to find out things.

Feedback is always appreciated.\nI was trained as a graduate student to read other people's research. Then I finished my special field exams and was told to go write some research. I compare my experience to learning how to read literature, then being asked to do creative writing. Not unrelated, but hardly the same set of skills. Here is some advice I found helpful when I was searching for a topic.\nHints for finding paper topics: Choosing a paper topic requires balancing the importance and feasibility of the topic. Feasibility involves tractability for theoretical research, and data availability for empirical research. I recommend creating a number of one-page paper proposals, each with a topic sentence and data source.\nThere are several heuristics for finding researchable paper topics. One way is to list three of four papers you like. This list may hint at the style, political point of view, level of abstraction, and methods that are appropriate for you.\nOther paper ideas are motivated by bad research, not good: find statements by policy-makers, analysts and journalists that make you angry, and find data sets to address the issue. When studying for exams, keep a list of stupid things you read to return to during the dissertation stage.\nDon't be afraid of normal science: repeating in a longitudinal data set what others have done only in the cross section. Some paper ideas are data-driven: read codebooks from a variety of data sets and see if certain questions spark ideas or tests of theories you find interesting. For every paper you read, think what else you would have done with that dataset or methodology.\nWrite a paper, not a dissertation. A dissertation can be a daunting prospect. If possible, focus on a 25-page paper with a clear one-sentence topic. If you like this paper, then it can become the basis of a dissertation. I promise you that just about any topic can grow to 150 pages; nearly all topics students first choose are WAY too broad.\nA dissertation is any stack of papers with three signatures on the top sheet. Paul Samuelson's dissertation was modestly entitled Foundations of Economics. It lived up to that title, and remains a classic to this day. I initially felt that my dissertation should be, if not that good, at least vaguely comparable in the sense of answering one of the Big Questions.\nDo not fall prey, as I did, to the \"magnum opus fallacy\". A dissertation should be normal science that certifies your competency. Save the big thoughts in a file, and get finished! Write an opus when you are a professor, and are being paid for it. Meanwhile, negotiate the smallest useful chunk of the Big Project with your dissertation advisers, and do that single piece of research.\nA dissertation group is essential. Having folks to bounce your ideas off of at an early stage is irreplaceable. The members of your dissertation group do not need to have similar fields; any smart person will be useful at each stage of a project, from vague ideas through research design, and write up. All you need are people who are willing to listen to raw ideas, and willing to read first \"pre-drafts\" of chapters.\nThis is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice. Collect them all! Dazzle your friends! Feel free to circulate to anyone who might find them useful.\nDavid Levine's Cheap Advice for Writing a Dissertation\nDavid Levine's Cheap Advice for Presenting Results\nDavid Levine's Cheap Advice for Going on the Job Market\nDavid Levine's Cheap Advice for Starting as a New Faculty\nWrite to David Levine, Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley CA 94720; levine@haas.berkeley.edu for additional Cheap Advice, or to give Cheap Advice back to the source. Feedback is always appreciated.\nWhen people evaluate you for tenure, they need to know (1) who you are, and (2) what (one or two sentences) results you are associated with. Thus, my basic advice is focus your research, get it read, and get seen. Sadly, the visibility of yourself is as important as the quality of your work in professional success.\nHave a theme: You should think of your research as writing a book, not articles. The idea is that your first five years' research should involve one or two unifying themes.\nThe reason for sticking to a theme is that people evaluating you need to be able to say \"This young scholar is one of the world's experts at _______.\" You get to fill the blank. However, your work must hold together so that there is some word or phrase they can stick in the blank.\nIn an ideal world, academics would be able to study any important topic they were competent to shed light on. In the real world, assistant professors are being evaluated; you don't need to play the game I describe, but now you know the rules.\nGet read: List people who should read your papers. The list should include at least three groups: a dozen or so senior people in your field who are likely to write letters evaluating you when you go up for tenure; classmates and other buddies who are likely to actually read the stuff; and people who work on related topics and you would like to cite your stuff. Make up a master list that receives most papers, and modify it for each paper. Look at each paper's bibliography for ideas on who might want to see it. (Everyone wants to see papers that cite them -- that's why so many professors read papers from the back.)\nTypically you should mail out papers in their working paper stage, one draft before submission.\nFeedback is crucial. All research has flaws, and all drafts have easy-to-correct flaws. Make sure your research and writing has lots of feedback to fix both types. Especially for the clarity issues, be open minded. If your parents, friends, colleagues in unrelated disciplines, will read the sucker, send it to them!\nGet seen: Travel every year to give seminars. If you are going to be near a university, call up six months early and tell them you are available and would like to give a seminar.\nDon't be shy: figure out how to give a talk at your field's annual convention, and do it! Invite a mix of friends and more well-known people.\nLearn how to be a Manager: Secretaries and research assistants are just a few of the people you need to learn to manage. The secrets are few: respect and communication. Respect is shown, for example, by asking their schedule when you propose work, and by always saying, \"Thank you.\" In addition, if they have expertise in a job, only give advice on how to do it if they ask.\nMost attempts at communication are not completely successful. (In the classroom this problem is reflected in my maxim: \"I can teach faster than they can learn.\") Thus, the golden rule of communication is \"Say unto others what you believe others have said unto you.\" After giving your instructions, always ask your RA to explain what she thought you asked her to do. (Do this in a way that makes it clear you consider yourself at fault for any miscommunication. Perhaps: \"I didn't explain that very well. Can you tell me what you are planning to do?\") If they don't repeat back to me their understanding of my instructions, then it is unlikely the job will be accomplished as I expect.\nBudget your research time: In economics research begun in year t usually leads to a first draft in year t+1 or t+2. Circulating it and presenting it at a seminar or two brings us to year t+3. Submit it to a journal and they will (if you are lucky) ask for a revision in year t+4, which you might complete that year. If so, they could accept it as fast as year t+5, but it might not come out till year t+6. On the one hand, many papers can move from conception to publication in less than six years; on the other hand, many papers take more.\nCount back from the time you need to submit your tenure file. If you are three years away and your case is less than 100% solid, don't begin any new research! At this point your priority must be to move working papers and papers with requested revisions into the Accepted pile.\nThis is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice. Collect them all!

That is, a reader should be able to understand a table without reference to the text (and preferably without reference to other tables). The converse rule is that the text should stand by itself, even if a reader ignores the tables.\nVariable names should be self-explanatory. The text should flow without ever showing that the reader has encountered a variable name. For example, \"Each plant visit by a social scientist corresponded to 3.1% higher voluntary turnover per month (SE = .9%, P < .05)\" is much better than \"The coefficient of SCISTUD on VOLTUR was .031 (.009),\" which is better than \"S and V were significantly related.\" In short, nobody should know what passed between you and your computer in the middle of the night. Name your dummy variable Male or Female, but not Sex.\nOften variables are proxies for conceptual variables. If you want to measure complexity, but your variable is log(employment), name the variable employment (if all variables are expressed in logs) or log(employment), not complexity.\nEach table has number and a meaningful title: \"Wages Do Not Rise with Tenure,\" not \"Wages.\"\nAll statistical tests include the name of the test, the test statistic, and the significance level. Include a brief description of complex procedures at the bottom of the table. Remind readers of the meaning of complicated variables.\nEach estimated equation lists the dependent variable and sample size. If one of these is constant for an entire table, list it only once. Always include measures of goodness of fit such as R\u00b2 or log-likelihood. Usually include a test of the significance of the entire regression (such as an F test for ordinary least squares), and appropriate residual diagnostics (such as Durbin-Watson statistics and heteroskedasticity tests).\nCoefficients should include standard errors or t statistics, and some indication of statistical significance (P values or * for P < .05, ** for P < .01). A note explains whether there are standard errors or t statistics. Report P < .10 only if the sample size is small. For very large datasets it makes sense to demand a higher degree of certainty, so only report P < .01.\nInclude a meaningful number of digits, usually at two or three significant places. Neither .34849560 (3.132534) nor 0.00 (SE = 0.00, P < .001) is useful. Sometimes multiply or divide a variable by 10 so the coefficient is in a meaningful range.\nAlways in the text, and often in the tables, translate the coefficients of interest into words. For example, convert logit coefficients to measure how a one-unit change in the variable affects the probability of the occurrence of the event (dP/dX). Translate hazard rate coefficients to show how a one unit change in the variable affects the expected time until some event occurs: \"If the union local is in a city, its expected lifetime was four months shorter than if it was rural.\"\nAlso, always explain whether the effect is large or not, perhaps by comparing its size to something readers understand. For example, the importance of marital status on wages can be expressed as how many years of education are required to raise wages by as much. Sometimes standardized coefficients (expressed in standard deviation units) are useful: \"A one month increase in training (approximately one standard deviation) corresponds to 4 percent lower turnover (approximately one half of a standard deviation).\"\nEffect sizes from Lisrel, factor analysis, path analysis, ordered logits, etc., are hard to understand. Thus, explain the size as well as the statistical significance of the important effects.\nStatistical significance: Most authors focus on whether coefficients are statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level. Thus, if b1 is statistically significant from zero at the 5% level, but b2 is not, some authors write as if b1 is different from and more important than b2. At a minimum, authors should focus on confidence intervals, and explicitly test if b1 and b2 differ by statistically significant amounts.\nSummary statistics should be included for the referee, although they do not always need to be in the paper. Usually include means, standard deviations, units, sources, geographical region covered, and sample size. Usually include summary statistics for control variables as well as for the main variables of interest. Include the statistics for the un-logged version of any important variables you use in log form. If your paper computes important and meaningful intermediate results (residuals from a first-stage equation, for example), include their summary statistics.\nOften give the referee a table of correlations of either the main variables or of all the variables.\nUse simple statistical procedures to complement fancier analyses. Many\npapers have a simple comparison of means as their main result (to be formalized\nand measured more precisely in later sections). If your paper has such a\ncomparison at its core, then present the unadjusted means (e.g., men vs. women,\nor\nFigures and graphs, like tables, are supposed to be comprehensible without reference to the text, and the text without reference to the figure. Place labels (in words, not symbols or variable names) and units on axes.\nEquations worthy of being in your paper can be expressed as a sentence. Do so. Many economic theories generate an interesting first-order condition. Restate it in words: \"At the optimum, a dollar spent today must bring the same utility as a dollar spent tomorrow, suitably discounted.\"\nAbstracts present the question the paper will answer. Since social scientists are not mystery writers, abstracts also summarize the results. Inability to write an abstract of fewer than 100 words often indicates deeper problems with the paper.\nNo research is perfect. This section presents a checklist of common imperfections in empirical research. Discuss the limitations of your paper and plausible alternate explanations for the results.\nSurveys face problems with the match between the actual sample and the perfect sample. Always mention the response rates and possible response biases. Are responses likely to be sensitive to changes in the wording of the questions? Do respondents have incentives to hide their attitudes? Are attitudes likely to match behaviors?\nA naming issue appears when data undergo factor analysis or are summed into an index. Do not merely name the factors or indices, but present a sample of the questions along with the factor weights. Differentiate exploratory from confirmatory factor analysis.\nEconometric and statistical analyses are subject to all the difficulties of surveys. They also fall prey to the \"textbook chapters:\" simultaneity, sample selection, measurement error, outliers, and so forth. Almost all analyses should use methods that adjust for clustering of the sample (as in most common datasets) and that are robust to the presence of heteroskedasticity. Re-analyze the data several times to check the specification, and make sure that your results are not sensitive to changes in the estimating technique, functional forms, control variables, and so forth. If all is well, allude to these results briefly, but do not include them in the paper. Often include copies of these tables for the referee.\nExperiments almost always have questionable external validity. Is there any reason to believe people in actual organizations involved in complex social networks making decisions that affect their careers over many years act the way the college sophomores do in your one-hour treatment?\nIs the name you have given your treatment appropriate? If you tell one group of people they are not worth the wage they receive, this treatment may affect self-esteem as well as perceived equity. Thus, naming the treated group perceived inequity can mislead readers.\nCase studies have limited generalizability. Explain in what sense this case study generalizes, and outline the limits of its generalizability. What are the likely biases due to subjective perception and reporting?\nCausality is almost never clear in the social sciences. Common problems include reverse causality, selection effects, and omitted variable bias. Discuss alternative causal explanations for the results. These alternative channels often suggest additional tests you might perform.\nWhen using instrumental variables or multi-equation methods such as two-stage least squares and maximum likelihood, always list your instruments or other identifying assumptions. Include these lists in both the text and the tables. Justify why it is plausible that your instruments are exogenous. Both identification by functional form (as in many sample selection models) and instrumenting with lagged variables require strong justification.\nEconomic theory: Explain the robustness of the results in \"assumption space.\" Differentiate assumptions that are crucial from those that merely simplify. Even if you do not prove, explain what happens if preferences are not Cobb-Douglas, or if agents are not identical. Usually include detailed derivations in an appendix for the referee.\nGo for clear exposition of substance as opposed to trying to impress readers with big words, hard statistics, or fancy theory. Present the main conclusions so that they will be accessible to the nonspecialist reader in the final section.\nUse footnotes sparingly, and Latin almost never. Don't rely on variable names if you can spell them out. Remind readers often of the meaning of your symbols: often replace q with \"the elasticity of substitution.\" Readers have to expand out the entire phrase--help them out.\nNo article has ever suffered from too much helpful advice from colleagues. Be sure many readers look at your article. Use family, friends, colleagues from other departments: most of your paper should be understandable even to the nonspecialist.\n[1] From the BPP class of 2006."

Here, the Oscar-winning director Walter Salles explains why it had to be made\nSaturday December 21, 2002\nThe Guardian\nIt begins with a chicken who knows too much. We are in City of God, a favela (a Rio de Janeiro slum) in the early 1980s. A gang of young drug-dealers is preparing feijoada, the local stew. This chicken knows that she is dead meat and tries desperately to escape. The tragi-comic scene that ensues determines the tone of City of God, a Brazilian film by Fernando Meirelles, co-directed by Katia Lund. The fleeing animal is chased and fired at by the young hoodlums until fate leads her under the wheels of a police car.\nArticle continues\nRarely has a film created such heated debate in Brazil. The country's current leader, Luiz Inacio da Silva, at the time the socialist presidential candidate, urged the then president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, to see City of God in order to understand the extent of the urban tragedy in Brazil. Cardoso did. Arnaldo Jabor, one of Brazil's most important intellectuals, wrote that \"this is not only a film. It is an important fact, a crucial statement, a hole in our national conscience.\"\nAfter I directed the Oscar-winning Central Station, our small production house had the opportunity to help a few films by upcoming Brazilian directors. The decision to be part of City of God was defined by the trust we had in Meirelles and his co-director, but also because few films could shed more light on the social apartheid of Brazil.\nThere are more than 40,000 violent deaths a year in Brazil, more than three times the total number of deaths in Kosovo. Many of these deaths in our urban areas are the result of confrontation between drug gangs, or between dealers and the police. What City of God achieves is the possibility to understand how we got to this chaos.\nIn the 1960s, families of immigrants expelled from their land in the north-east of the country found an illusory refuge in the slums of the capital, Rio de Janeiro. The marginalised youth living on the fringe of society at that time had to bend to strict familial codes and rules. The drug was marijuana, which inspired a contemplative, \"romantic\" lifestyle. Gun use at the time was sporadic and the ends justified the means.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s everything changed. The first large drug-dealers appeared and outlaws ceased to lead a nomadic life and settled their businesses in the heart of the favelas. These dealers began to control the communities in which they operated and created a parallel system of justice within their borders. Cocaine became the drug of choice and the .38 was traded for the AK47 and other machine guns. The death toll grew dramatically and the dealers became younger and younger. It was hell.\nCity of God follows several real characters, whose lives started and ended within the favela's perimeter during these three decades. Bene, the cool marijuana dealer, Ze Peque\u00f1o, a merciless killer, and Rocket, the innocent eye, Lins's alter ego, a young black kid who manages to break the country's social and race barriers - at a price.\nMost of the film's actors are kids from amateur theatre groups in favelas, or non-actors found in a year-long casting effort in these communities. The directors rehearsed them for more than six months before the shoot and improvisation was encouraged. Like other directors in Brazil, I am used to working with non-actors, but I still do not know how Meirelles and Lund managed to achieve such a sense of realism.\nDo not expect pity or redemption. There are no such things in City of God. This is the depiction of a world where people have been forgotten for too long by the Brazilian ruling classes; a world where the state does not provide proper health or education services. In fact, the only items it provides freely are bullets.\nNow for the present: a time when the olvidados got tired of being forgotten, a time of diffuse, uncontrollable violence. \" City of God is not only a portrait of our favelas, it is also our portrait, at 24 frames a second, our faces blurred with the faces of 10-year-old children holding machine guns. All the manifestations of our chaos become visible. This film will be seen by the whole country in terror, and I believe it will cause transformations in the political arena,\" says Jabor.\nThere were also dissonant voices in Brazil, arguing that the film gives the impression that favelas are populated only by drug-dealers. They are not. In fact, an immense part of the Brazilian population has been the victim of this present state. This is when we realise that the chicken caught in the cross-fire at the beginning of City of God is not only a chicken. It is the reflection of so many Brazilians trapped in an unjust country.\n\u00b7 City of God is released on January 3.\nThe following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Tuesday January 14 2003\nAn editing error introduced the claim that the director's earlier film, Central Station, was an Oscar winner. It was nominated for best foreign film in 1999, but it did not win the Academy Award.\nPrintable version | Send it to a friend | Save story"

John Sayles\nSony Pictures Classics\nThe torching of a tacky float during \"Buccaneer\nDays\" opens John Sayles' Sunshine\nState. Pirates of all types abound in fictional\nPlantation Island, Fla., a small town suffering its\nconversion from a place of character and history into\none of those upscale, pastel resorts you speed past on\nI-95. The ensemble cast is split by the dividing line\nof the movie's primary concern: To sell out or not\nsell out? As it's Florida, there's plenty of sun, sea\nand palms, golfers in white slacks, weary locals in\ndenims; and, as it's John Sayles territory, our\nsympathies are meant to fall wholly on the side of the\ngrassroots townies.\nThe heart of the film is split between two daughters.\nMarly Temple (Edie Falco) is the proprietor of a small\nmotel; after getting dumped by her golf-pro\nboyfriend, she couples up with a nicer example of one of\nthe enemy, landscape architect Jack Meadows (Timothy\nHutton). Marly longs to sell the motel her father (a\ngrizzled, speechifying Ralph Waite) has pushed on her\nas his personal dream to maintain. A former \"Weeki\nWachee Mermaid,\" Marly exudes a knowing\nworld-weariness, the threat of the encroaching\ndevelopers awakening in her a desire for flight. By\ncontrast, Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett) returns to\nnext-town-over Lincoln Beach (based on the actual\nAfrican-American community of American Beach, Fla.,\nfounded in 1935) to wrestle with a difficult mother\nand finds herself staying to fight for the home from\nwhich she was exiled years before. As in Sayles'\nPassion Fish, two women, one immobilized and\nwhite, the other itinerant and black, share the\nemotional center of the film. The social ecosystem\naround these women gradually reveals itself as a net\nthat grips, either as a trap or as necessary support.\nIn weaving his morality play, Sayles has chosen sides\nand doles out the vice and virtue in a\nstraightforward, if simplistic, manner. Those on the\nside of maintaining the old community have all the\ndignity, pathos and deeply felt issues to be played\nout; those who favor gentrification have all the\nneuroses they are suicidal gambling addicts,\nbitter former beauty queens, wounded semi-pro athletes\nturned car salesmen, heartless local politicos,\nclownish fat golfers, trailer park Civil War\nreenactors.\nThe decks are stacked against these folks,\nat times mere foils to Sayles' soapboxing. Francine\nPickney (Mary Steenburgen) is the town's Chamber of\nCommerce queen bee, an\narchetype dusted off from nearly every Robert Altman\nfilm, married to troubled banker Earl Pickney (Gordon\nClapp, the wimpy cop from \"NYPD Blue\"). Flash Philips\n(Tom Wright) is the ex-linebacker (he skipped out long\nago after getting a teenage Angela Bassett pregnant)\nhired as front man for a car dealership, itself the\nfront for some nameless, faceless corporate entity\nbuying up all the homes in Lincoln Beach. Miguel\nFerrer has a too-brief gem of a scene planning his\nhard-sell strategy like a wartime general. Alan King\nand Clifton James are two stogie-chomping golfers who\neventually run out of green, playing ironic Greek\nchorus to the proceedings (\"Nature! Who needs it?\")\nThese are folks, Sayles tells us with the\nsubtlety of tractors plowing through an ancient Indian\ngraveyard, neither to be pitied nor trusted; they are,\nin the end, comic relief.\nIn a similar dramatic cul de sac, Sayles shows the\nsame love of loose ends he practiced in Limbo, by dealing us a\nbig wooden red herring of a plot point. Acting teacher\nDelia Temple, played by former NEA chairwoman Jane\nAlexander, hires a pyromaniac teen to build her a\ncoffin for her upcoming solo performance of Faulkner's\n\"As I Lay Dying.\" Beyond two minor scenes involving\nthe construction and delivery of the coffin, nothing\nelse ever comes of this (ever-unoccupied) box. This\nall seems to be Sayles at his most didactic: Is he in\nmourning for the NEA, paved over by the new anti-art\nmorality?\nThe film's strength is quieter than Sayles' politics,\nwhich, despite his broad strokes, displays genuine,\nadult interest in the demarcation of character\n(refreshing in this summer of animated sci-fi\nspectacles). People decide to sell out, love, forgive or remain entrenched in their need\nto believe in the American dream; and their paths\nshift, slightly yet deeply. Even the climax is a\nminor, if momentous, affair: What halts the progress\n(or destruction) is not the human endeavor on either\nside of the battle, but the ghosts of the past. The\ndead demand attention, and rising from their graves\n(literally), they stop the major conflict of\nSunshine State in its tracks.\nThe powerbrokers, the moneymen, the sharks in on the\nmoney trail, all leave town when the tractors halt.\nMen leave, Sayles seems to say; they are either\nwalking out on women or paving over things. What's\nleft in the vacuum is the film's true concern: the\nwomen who have to clean things up. Sayles may be his\nown best example of a male involved in his own drama\nwhile a quieter, more human story resolves itself on\nthe sidelines. This character-driven quality has\nalways been in Sayles' films, and bringing together\nsuch distinct concerns as presenting\nbroad social canvas, as in Matewan, and telling\nthe African-American's story\nundiluted, as in The Brother From Another Planet,\nmakes Sunshine State his\nmost comprehensive film to date. And he does it\nquietly: The prodigal daughter who has returned is\nable to stay, and the one who had been stuck at home\nhas, like all true mermaids, returned to the sea.\nStephen Bracco (sbracco@yahoo.com)\nOfficial Site\nIMDB entry\nTrailer\nFlak: Review of Limbo\nAll materials copyright \u00a9 1999-2006 by Flak Magazine"

        "articleBody": "Feeling tremendous pressure to grant Ireland Home Rule, Britain began to talk\nabout making efforts to \"pacify\" Ireland, implying that it would indeed grant\ntheir wish. Talks of Home Rule were then delayed. The Irish saw the delay as a\nfurther political tactic of a British parliament who had no intention of\ngranting them autonomy. The British struggled with the question of who would\nrun this complex society that was so heavily rooted in imperialistic tradition,\nand who at best had a shaky industrial and political structure. This delay\nfurther divided Irish nationalists. New radical forms of nationalism emerged,\nsuch as the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Sinn Fein, whose leaders were\nwilling to use violent means if necessary to secure Irish independence.\nA further divide between Protestants and Catholics also developed at this time,\nparticularly in the northern province of Ulster. Unionists groups, who were\nProtestant by religion and British by tradition, were opposed to Home Rule\nbecause they believed that Ireland should maintain her ties to Britain. In an\neffort to resist the Home Rule movement, they began to organize. They created a\nProvisional Government of Ulster, complete with a constitution and raised an\narmy to defend it. Further to that, in 1912 they created what was called the\n`Solemn League and Covenant' which bound their followers to use any means\nnecessary to resist Home Rule. They gathered over a half a million signatures,\nsome of the Unionists even signing in their own blood.\nThe debate over Home Rule was put on hold when World War I broke out. The\nDublin Easter Rising of 1916 served as a reminder to the British that the\nquestion of Ireland's independence would need to be answered when the war was\nover. Over 220 people were killed and over 600 more injured when Irish\nRepublican Brotherhood rebels took hold of Dublin. The British, outnumbering\nthe rebels 20 to 1, eventually took back the city six days later. In the face\nof what could have been a political victory for the British, they made the error\nof executing the surviving Irish rebels, martyring them and instilling anger and\ndetermination in the minds of many Irish Nationalists.\nThe dilemma of Home Rule as the British saw it was how to given the Irish\nCatholics what they wanted while still providing for the Irish Protestants of\nUlster. Their answer was the Government of Ireland Act of 1920, which created\ntwo separate parliaments, one in the North and one in the South. These\nparliaments were charged with their own domestic affairs, but all foreign\naffairs and income tax collection remained in the hands of the British.\nFurther resistance and guerilla warfare eventually led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty\nof 1921, which outlined the creation of the Irish Free State, now known as the\nRepublic of Ireland. It was made up of the provinces of Munster, Leinster and\nConnaught, as well as three of the nine counties of Ulster - Donegal, Monaghan,\nand Cavan. Northern Ireland, now a legal entity made of up the six remaining\ncounties of Ulster - Fermanagh, Armagh, Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim and Down -\nremained under British rule. The division created an almost entirely Catholic\npopulation in the South of Ireland and a substantial Protestant majority in the\nNorth.\nThe partitioning of Ireland was viewed by the South as a temporarily solution to\nthe `Protestant' problem in the North. They maintained that not an inch of\nIrish land would be given up to the British. In 1937, the creation of the Irish\nConstitution in the South laid claim to the six counties that remained under\nBritish rule and acknowledged that they were being held temporarily and\nillegally.\nPopulation divisions had always existed in the two major cities of what was now\nNorthern Ireland. Belfast, the largest city and center of economic activity had\na largely Protestant population, where as Derry, a key center for the shipping\nindustry had a largely Catholic population. Both cities also boasted a\nconcentrated minority group, yet conflict was not always inherent, as the\nminority did not pose a threat to the majority's way of life. With the rise of\nindustrialization, there was a rapid migration of people to Belfast,\npredominantly in search of work and housing. The majority of the people\nmigrating were Catholic, which began to present a problem for the Protestant\ncommunity. Not only were they competing for housing and employment, but the\npercentage of Catholics in Belfast was not only rising, but they were beginning\nto organize. As they learned how to use political institutions to wield\ninfluence, the Protestants became more resentful of their presence. To the\nCatholics, their eventual control over Belfast was inevitable. As Bernard\nHughes, the only Roman Catholic representative on the Belfast City Council in\n1857 stated, \"This town (Belfast) is governed by Protestants, but the bone and\nsinew of the town is Roman Catholic.\"(Brewer & Higgins 1998). What was born was\na conflict between the working class members of society, while the middle and\nupper classes struggled to maintain peaceful control. The peace was not to\nlast.\nThe decades to follow would be wrought with violence. Battles would be waged\nbetween the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Ulster Defense Association and\nBritish paramilitaries. Thousands of innocent people would be killed in bomb\nblasts, riots and sectarian killings. Even law abiding citizens lend support to\nthese groups, because the battle for the \"Cause\" on either side is paramount.\nWhat is it that turns these common citizens into killing machines? What\nprevents any kind of peace agreements from taking hold in this conflict ridden\nnation? The answer is perhaps more complicated than the conflict.\nTheorists have struggled over a solution to \"the Troubles\" in Northern Ireland\nfor a number of years. Yet in seeking this solution, few have truly gotten\ninside the conflict. Northern Ireland's battle has produced not only an\nenormous human cost but also a unique population that has been raised in\nviolence. Understanding that population is key to any sort of peace agreement.\nThat understanding lies in examining what motivates both sides of the conflict.\nThe battle over land is one of the most common sources of conflict in history.\nIt is not surprising then that it plays a role in this conflict. To the Irish,\ntheir identity was rooted in the Church and the Land. British imperialism saw\nthe implementation of land lordship in Ireland. Protestant landlords rented\nland to Catholic tenants, turning an economic system into one wrought with deep\nreligious animosity. This represented not only conquest but religious\npersecution to the Irish. (Hickey 1984)\nThe Famine of 1845-1849 was a significant set back in Anglo-Irish relations. It\nrepresented a failure of the British government to provide for the basic needs\nof the Irish. It was also seen by some as an attempt to pacify the Irish\nthrough starvation. The relief offered to Catholics during the famine also\nfurthered the divide between Protestants and Catholics, as it was often offered\non the condition that they attend a Protestant church. It was becoming clear\nto Irish Catholics that the root of their hardship lay with the British and\nIrish nationalism gained momentum.\nAnother one of the theories that have been presented is that the conflict is\nrooted in ethnic or cultural difference. The obvious critique to this idea is\nthat the Protestant and the Catholic groups have one major thing in common -\nthey are all Irish. Yet, these two groups would tend to differ in that belief.\nThe label Protestant has come to signify the Irish of the North that identify\nthemselves with British tradition. They pledge allegiance to the British Crown\nand fight to maintain ties to Britain. Despite the fact that they were likely\nborn in Ireland, they tend to associate themselves with being British. They are\nalso referred to as Unionists, Loyalists or Orangemen. On the flip side of that\nare the Catholics. The population that falls under this label is considered\nethnically Irish. They fight for a united Ireland, free from British rule.\nThey attempt to maintain the Irish language of Gaelic, and although there are\nfew places left that use it pre-dominantly, it is still taught in Roman Catholic\nschools. These people are often referred to as Nationalists or Republicans.\nThe Irish argument then is that there is a distinctly `Irish' culture that is\nbeing stifled by a `British' majority in Northern Ireland. The two keys\nelements of the `Irish' culture that make co-existence near impossible are that\nit is rooted in a nationalist ideology and that Catholic beliefs are intertwined\nwith that ideology. Their belief is that harmony can only exist when all of\nIreland is united and the assimilation of the non-Irish is complete.\nThe major problem with this plan is two-fold. Firstly, Protestants have a\nculture which they believe in and defend and do not wish to sacrifice.\nSecondly, Northern Ireland has existed as an independent state for over 80\nyears, and has likely developed a kind of culture that is unique and that may\nnot blend well with the culture of the Republic of Ireland.\nReligion seems to be the element that ties many of the theories on the conflict\ntogether. Under the above pretense, the labels Catholic and Protestant are used\nto convey cultural and political connotations. Yet religion remains an integral\npart of ones culture. In the battle over land, religion maintains its tie\nthrough the battle between Protestant landlords and Catholic tenants. Religion\neven has political links, as many nationalists, such as D.P. Morgan, the founder\nof the Leader newspaper, believe that the two ideas are inseparable:\n\"When we look out on Ireland we see that those who\nbelieve, or may be immediately induced to believe, in\nIreland as a nation are, as a matter of fact, Catholics...\nIf a non-Catholic nationalist Irishman does not wish to\nlive in a Catholic atmosphere let him turn Orangeman.\" (Hickey 1984)\nIt is important then to look seriously at the role that religion plays in the\nconflict in Northern Ireland.\nThere are two sides to the religion debate. One the one hand, some believe that\nthe labels Protestant and Catholic are just that - labels used to define two\nwarring factions of the conflict in the absence of a real ethnic divide. Given\nthat one can point to ideas of territorial dispute, nationalism and culture as\npotential sources of conflict, it is easy to see where this opinion is formed.\nYet when examined more closely, there is merit in the argument that there are\ndogmatic differences in the two religions which keep the conflict at a\nstalemate. While both Protestantism and Catholicism are forms of Christianity,\nthe beliefs surrounding how society should be structured can lead to political\nconflict.\nCatholicism is a very closely knit religion. One of the key elements of the\nbelief is in the emphasis placed on prayer and sacraments. The individual who\nadministers these sacraments becomes of the utmost importance, which results in\nthe creation of the priesthood. This suggests a social order where the leaders\nhave significant control over the systems of a society.\nProtestantism in contrast is based much more loosely. It is composed of several\nforms of Christianity, including Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist and\nthe Church of Ireland. The appeal is much more direct - one where the minister\nprepares parishioners to meet God directly. This poses a direct threat to the\nstructured organization of the Roman Catholic faith. Likewise, Protestants fear\nthat if Ireland is united, their faith will be consumed by Catholicism.\nUltimately, the result is that the religious divide between these two groups is\nnot merely in symbolic membership, but also in the interpretation of the\nChristian faith. As indicated by Professor John Hickey, \"it is more a question\nof religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion.\" (Hickey\n1984) Religion is often downplayed as a cause of the conflict in Northern\nIreland because Western pluralistic societies do not place as much emphasis on\nthe importance of religion in daily life.\nThe question then becomes how does one find a solution to a conflict that\nis so multifaceted? Belfast child psychologist Morris Frazer indicates\nthat what Northern Ireland is now faced with is \"a generation of children\nwho have lived with fear, have been taught to hate and who now aspire to\nkill.\" (Morrissey and Smyth 2002). Here in lies the starting point to\nresolution - education. It has become clear that in order to implement\na peace agreement between Protestants and Catholics, and to make positive\nprogress towards a bi-national state, a bottom-up approach must be used.\nThere are a few key things that must be taken into consideration by all sides.\nThe first is that violence is not now, nor will it ever be, a successful\nbargaining tool. Further to that is the idea that a peace agreement cannot end\nat the absence of direct violence. Progress must be made towards a model of\npositive peace. In order to achieve this, negotiations must consider the\npositions of the minority - Catholics in Northern Ireland and Protestants in\nIreland as a whole. No one groups' rights can be infringed upon. This would\nlead almost naturally to the idea of a bi-national state. Coexistence is the\nbest chance that Ireland has at unification. It is the only real way to obtain\npositive peace and a stable infrastructure.\nPeace Process\nBombings, shootings and countless other acts. Will the violence ever end?\nWill peace and stability ever come? These were the questions that\nfor most of Northern Irelands history best described prospects for a\nsolution. For generations unionist and nationalist communities had been\nseparated as well as isolated from each other, turning to demonstrations\nof community strength to meeting with each other in negotiation and\ncooperation. For the most part, the earliest attempts at peace attempted\nto make only mechanical political solutions. These only reinforced\nthe already opposing relationships. Relative calm followed the Ireland\nAct of 1949, which created the Republic of Ireland in the south. By the\n1950s, even Catholics in the North, still securely tethered to Britain,\nseemed ready to accept equality rather than pushing for securing a more\nunited Ireland, scholars note. But that changed after Northern Ireland's\nCatholics organized a large demonstration protesting discrimination\nin voting rights, housing and unemployment in 1968. A police crackdown\nfollowed, sparking months of violence and a reemergence of the Republican\nmovement. The subsequent bloody riots between Protestants and Catholics\nmarked the beginning of The Troubles, the euphemism for the period of\nviolence that would continue for years in Northern Ireland.\nBoth the Irish Republican and British sides experienced breakthroughs in the\n1980s that would help to prepare the ground for the peace process. The\npropaganda campaign around the hunger strikes started the Sinn Fein involvement\nin electoral politics and community action. It was this event that started a\ntransformation. This was the beginning of Sinn Fein's ascendancy over the IRA.\nThis was the beginning of a shift in emphasis from a military strategy to a\nprimarily political one, and a lowering margin of victory on which the\nRepublican outlook was focused, from the absolute principle of the right of the\nIrish people as a whole to self-determination towards ensuring that the\nimmediate interests of their core base of support were sufficiently represented\nin and by British state institutions. This move into party politics would end\nup leading Sinn Fein to end their commitment to not take their seats in the\nDail, a commitment which had been a key principle for Republicans since as far\nback as the 1920s. In taking their seats in the Irish Parliament and later in\nlocal councils in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein was explicitly recognizing\ninstitutions set up under partition and thus implicitly recognizing the\npartition of the country itself.\nWhen Republicans did engage in a peace process contacts like nationalist John\nHume were to be important. With the additional support from sections of\nIrish-America this cooperation with 'constitutional' nationalism became the\npan-nationalist alliance. This connection acted as the go through which\nRepublicans were able to ease their movement from a confrontational approach to\na placatory one. The role of intermediaries was to become very important in the\npeace process. During the late 1980s contacts were made and a network of\nconnections developed. But at this stage the contacts were largely secret and\nunfruitful, a reflection of both the pariah status of Republicans and the\ndistance between their stance and that of other political actors\nIt was not until these existing relationships were challenged, most crucially in\nthe Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and subsequently in several other initiatives\njointly determined by the British and Irish governments, that the main parties\nbegan to participate in efforts to create a democratic peace. The search for\npeace had always been overwhelmed by the violence that reinforced separation.\nThe British government's negotiation and signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement\nwith the government of the Republic of Ireland in 1985 marked some developments\nthat were to be important for the peace process. The Agreement brought the\nBritish government closer with the government of the Republic of Ireland. This\nwas also significant for moving away from viewing Northern Ireland as a purely\ndomestic matter for the British government. The introduction and maintenance of\nthe Agreement was achieved against the express wishes of Ulster unionists. This\nwas an indication of the declining power of the Unionists in Northern Ireland.\nUnlike the Power-sharing Assembly of 1974, Unionists failed in their attempts to\nwreck the Agreement. Such a failure also indicated that the British government\nwas prepared to face down Unionist opposition.\nThe current peace process began in April 1993 when John Hume, leader of the\nSDLP, and Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, met to discuss the future of\nNorthern Ireland. An idea of determination for the people of Ireland was a\nmajor priority. And they hoped these discussions would lead to a historical\nagreement between the British and Irish governments. A key element of this\ndiscussion was that Britain should be willing to allow the people of Ireland to\ndecide their own political future. This meant that they had to accept the\npossibility of a united Ireland. Furthermore, they were to call on Britain to\ndeclare it had no selfish, political, strategic, or economic interest in\nNorthern Ireland.\nSF in past years had shown some signs that they wished to peacefully and\ndemocratically reach a political settlement in Northern Ireland. Through their\ncoming together, Hume and Adams signaled a change in the Nationalists approach\nto the Northern Irish situation which would, eventually, entail Republicans\nbeing willing to abandon violence. In this approach, Nationalist leaders hoped\nto appeal to a much larger percentage of the nationalist community and to the\nIrish people of the Republic. Violence had reduced support for the Nationalist\ncause in the Republic of Ireland. The task of SF would be to convince the IRA\nthat they could achieve their political aims without the use of paramilitary\nforce.\nThe discussions between Hume and Adams would be the driving factor to talks\nbetween the British and Irish governments. In June 1993 both governments came\ntogether to discuss the future of each governments relationship to Northern\nIreland. For six months, both governments would try to reach a compromise. The\nmain debate focused on the question of self-determination. In the end the\nBritish government could not accept self-determination for the people of Ireland\nas a whole. On 15 December 1993 the Joint Declaration on Peace was released.\nTo Republicans, the declaration was not seen as a solution to the conflict\nbetween the two communities. The document claimed to create a structure in\nwhich a peaceful political settlement could come about.\nBoth British and Irish governments knew that no democratic process could be\ninfluenced by violence. It was also known that if the talks were to produce any\nlasting settlement the process would have to be as inclusive as possible. The\nabsence of political parties that represented the various paramilitary groups\nwas seen as a drawback to the possibility of a permanent settlement. Therefore,\nit was considered essential that Loyalist and Republican paramilitary groups\nshould be encouraged to enter into cease-fires.\nWhile politicians had struck a compromise, paramilitary groups had not.\nRepublicans spent some time seeking clarification on the Joint Agreement. Only\nwhen they felt the agreement would allow them to pursue their objectives\npolitically would they consider a cease-fire. Loyalist violence was a response\nto Republican violence, but it was also a sign of their insecurity regarding\ntheir relationship with the British government. Although unionists were in the\nmajority in Northern Ireland and the document would only allow a united Ireland\nto be achieved by majority consent from the Northern Ireland population,\nunionists no longer felt they help the power.\nThe SF put a lot of effort into the process that eventually was to bring about\nan IRA cease-fire. SF was convinced that the IRA's objectives could be achieved\nbetter through democratic means. The SF argument clearly influenced the leaders\nof the IRA. On 31 August 1994 the IRA announced their cease-fire. Though it was\na victory for peace, it was not an all-inclusive Republican cease-fire. There\nwere other less known groups such as the Irish National Liberation Army and\nRepublican Sinn Fein that did not consider themselves bound by the IRA's\ncease-fire. A long and violent six weeks had past before the CLMC announced a\ncease-fire of their own.\nIn 1995 both governments introduced a new Framework for Agreement. Peace in\nNorthern Ireland helped the British and Irish governments find a new confidence\nin their dialogue. Not only was the document a continuation of issues discussed\nin The Joint Declaration for Peace, it also introduced new ideas for future\ngovernmental structures. Not everybody in the nationalist community rejected\nthe framework. Some believed the agreement would be beneficial for the common\ngood, the proposed structures had the potential to benefit both communities\neconomically. However, the unionists did not see it in the same way. They felt\nthreatened and betrayed by the document, particularly by the proposed\nNorth/South structures. In their opinion, a North/South institution with any\nkind of political power was a sure sign of a step towards Irish unity.\nThe decommissioning of paramilitary arms became an important issue as Northern\nIreland moved towards multi-party talks. It became apparent that some of the\nparticipants would only accept those parties, who were linked to paramilitary\norganizations, into a talk's process if weapons were first handed over.\nOpposing parties saw this not only as unrealistic but also as an unfair\nprecondition on the entry to talks. Despite the Mitchell report, the British\ndecided a separate committee should be formed on the question of decommissions.\nThis didn't go over well with Sinn Fein or the IRA. On February 9th, the IRA\nended their cease-fire. The process was to go on.\nTalks opened June 1996. The UDP and PUP were allowed to remain in talks because\nthe CLMC Cease-fire had held under difficult circumstances. As expected, SF was\nnot allowed to enter the talks because the IRA had not resumed its cease-fire\nbefore the talks began. It would stay without Sinn Fein and be overshadowed by\nIRA violence most of the time. As September 1997 grew closer, and SF recognized\nthe British government's desire to include them in the talks or else proceed\nwithout them, the Republican movement reassessed its political situation. John\nHume argued that a resumption of the cease-fire was once again within reach of\nthe government. On July 18th Hume and Adams released a joint statement that\nsaid lasting commitment would only be achieved if it is based on principles of\ndemocracy and equality and has the allegiance of both traditions. Two days\nlater, the IRA resumed its cease-fire. Both governments reacted with reserved\nhope and waited to see if the cease-fire was genuine. If it were clear the IRA\nhad abandoned all paramilitary activity for six weeks, then SF would be allowed\nto enter the talks in September. The cease-fire held, SF was admitted into the\ntalks, and not surprisingly, their arrival marked the departure of the DUP and\nUKUP. After a sincere effort by both governments to make the multi-party talks\nall inclusive, the talks still lacked representation from all parties.\nViolence had a direct impact on multi-party talks as the early months of 1998\nbrought the suspension of two parties from the process. The UDP and SF, after\nboth governments concluded that they had breached the Mitchell principles. The\nUDP is considered as the political wing of the paramilitary group the UDA / UFF\nwhich had been linked to many killings. It was made clear that they would be\nallowed back into the talks after a period of time if they remained committed to\nthe Mitchell principles. In late February 1998, SF was also suspended from the\ntalks. Both governments believed those two killings, that of a Loyalist\nparamilitary and a Catholic drug dealer, was the work of the IRA. As the talks\nwere nearing the May 1998 deadline, the two governments set an exclusion of two\nweeks provided there were no further breaches of the Mitchell principles. A\nlittle less than a month after the UDP walked out of the talks, they rejoined\nthem on 23 February 1998. Despite Unionist claims that the IRA was linked to\nrecent bombings, SF also were allowed back in the talks on 23 March 1998.\nIn an effort to overcome the political gridlock, the independent chairman of the\nmulti-party talks set a deadline for agreement as the 9 April 1998. The\ndeadline did give the process a new sense of urgency and had been a good idea.\nDuring the last week of March and the first week of April serious problems still\nlay in the path of a political. Not surprisingly, Unionists and Nationalists\nwere divided over how power would be shared in the proposed Northern Ireland\nAssembly, and the extent to which the Irish government would have influence over\nNorthern Ireland under the proposed North-South structures.\nIn retrospect, the tensions that were apparent between the various groupings\nwere an indication of the historical compromise that was being asked of all\nsides. The midnight deadline, of 9 April 1998, was not achieved but parties and\ngovernments stayed at the Stormont castle until an agreement was reached. The\nimminent arrival of the Easter weekend, and the prospect of a collapse of the\ntalks, gave the process and participants a last push. The news of the\nAgreement was reported in the late afternoon on Good Friday. Amazingly all the\nparties involved in the talks attended the final session in which George\nMitchell announced that an agreement had been reached and that the multi-party\ntalks were at end. Those involved in the process were careful not to claim it\nas a victory for any particular party, but rather as the best agreement that\ncould be achieved in the circumstances.\nIs this a complicated process? It most definitely is, but it is not impossible.\nSome people feared that these events would derail the peace process. Others were\ndetermined not to let that happen. After the 1998 Omagh bombing incident, a\nspokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, What the last few days\nactually have shown is that the Agreement and the peace process have survived\nand have emerged strengthened from the process.\nIt is unclear yet whether this sentiment is true, or is merely wishful thinking.\nIn the past, there have been agreements reached that subsequently fell apart.\nWill this one be different? Maintaining this agreement will require tremendous\nwillpower on both sides. People who have traditionally resolved disputes through\nthe use of guns and bombs will have to learn the art of compromise. On the day\nthe agreement was reached, President Clinton said:\n\"All friends of Ireland and Northern Ireland know the task of making the peace\nendure will be difficult. The path of peace is never easy. But the parties have\nmade brave decisions. They have chosen hope over hate, the promise of the future\nover the poison of the past. And in so doing, already they have written a new\nchapter in the rich history of their island -- a chapter of resolute courage\nthat inspires us all.\"\nIt seems clear that the majority of people are ready to undertake this challenge\nin return for a peaceful existence. Will their leaders be able to follow their\nwishes? Only time will tell.\nBibliography\nBrewer, John D. and Gareth I. Higgins: Anti-Catholicism in Northern\nIreland, 1600-1998.
