Personally made dataset:
CH: result_pzh           precision=0.805 ± 0.068  recall=0.725 ± 0.074  F1=0.763 ± 0.066 accuracy=0.056 ± 0.054
Update:
CH: result_pzh           precision=0.770 ± 0.062  recall=0.744 ± 0.064  F1=0.757 ± 0.055 accuracy=0.048 ± 0.045

Methodology 1: Changing xpaths.py
A few modification:
CH: result_pzh           precision=0.779 ± 0.059  recall=0.831 ± 0.055  F1=0.804 ± 0.051 accuracy=0.000 ± 0.000

Proves that this is actually a method.

Methodology 2: With observation, we have found that there are several navigation bars are not well extracted
                At the same time, author info are not well extracted as well. As a result, here we will try to
                extract them.
Several modifications:
result_pzh           precision=0.922 ± 0.037  recall=0.904 ± 0.026  F1=0.913 ± 0.022 accuracy=0.200 ± 0.089


Benchmark
